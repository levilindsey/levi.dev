The **nodes** are represented by points along the different surfaces in the level (floors, walls, and ceilings). The **edges** are represented by possible movement trajectories between points along surfaces. There are different types of edges for different types of movement (e.g., jumping from a floor to a floor, falling from a wall, walking along a floor). At run time, **[A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)** is used to calculate a path to a given destination.\r\n\r\nSome features include:\r\n-   Walking on floors, climbing on walls, climbing on ceilings, jumping and falling from anywhere.\r\n-   [Variable-height jump and fast-fall](https://kotaku.com/the-mechanics-behind-satisfying-2d-jumping-1761940693).\r\n-   Adjusting movement trajectories around intermediate surfaces (such as jumping over a wall or under an overhang).\r\n-   Configurable movement parameters on a per-player basis (e.g., horizontal acceleration, jump power, gravity, collision boundary shape and size, which types of edge movement are allowed).\r\n-   Level creation using Godot's standard pattern with a [TileMap in the 2D scene editor](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/tutorials/2d/using_tilemaps.html).\r\n-   Preparsing the level into a platform graph, and using A* search for efficient path-finding at runtime.\r\n-   A powerful inspector for analyzing the platform graph, in order to debug and better understand how edges were calculated.\r\n\r\n## Buy why?\r\n\r\nBecause there aren't many other good tools out there for intelligent pathfinding in a platformer.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of platformers use pretty simple computer-player AI for movement--for example:\r\n-   Walk to edge, turn around, repeat.\r\n-   Jump continuously, moving forward.\r\n-   Move with a regular bounce or surface-following pattern.\r\n-   Move horizontally toward the human player, \"floating\" vertically as needed in order to move around obstacles and platforms.\r\n\r\nMost examples of more sophisticated AI pathfinding behavior are usually still pretty limited. One common technique uses machine-learning and is trained by hundreds to thousands of human-generated jumps on an explicit pre-fabricated level. This makes level-generation difficult and is not flexible to dynamic platform creation/movement.\r\n\r\nThere are two key reasons why good path-finding AI isn't really used in platformers:\r\n1.  It's hard to implement right; there is a lot of math involved, and there are a lot of different edge cases to account for.\r\n2.  Dumb AI is usually plenty effective on its own to create compelling gameplay. The user often doesn't really notice or care how simple the behavior is.\r\n\r\nBut there are use-cases for which we really benefit from an AI that can accurately immitate the same movement mechanics of the player. One example is if we want to be able to control the player by tapping on locations that they should move through the level toward. Another example is if we want to have a flexible game mode in which a computer player can swap in for a human player depending on how many humans are present.\r\n\r\n## Platformer AI\r\n\r\n### The platform graph: Pre-parsing the world\r\n\r\nSurfacer depends on the level being represented as a [`TileMap`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_tilemap.html#class-tilemap).\r\n\r\nIn order for our AI to traverse our world, we first need to parse the world into a platform graph. We do this up-front, when the level is loaded, so that we can efficiently search the graph at run time. Dynamic updates to the graph can be performed at runtime, but these could be expensive if not done with care.\r\n\r\nThe nodes of this graph correspond to positions along distinct surfaces. Since our players can walk on floors, climb on walls, and climb on ceilings, we store floor, wall, and ceiling surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe edges of this graph correspond to a type of movement that the player could perform in order to move from one position on a surface node to another.\r\n-   These edges are directional, since the player may be able to move from A to B but not from B to A.\r\n-   The ends of an edge could be along the same surface or on different surfaces (e.g., for climbing up a wall vs jumping from a floor).\r\n-   There could be multiple edges between a single pair of nodes, since there could be multiple types of movement that could get the player from the one to the other.\r\n-   These edges are specific to a given player type. If we need to consider a different player that has different movement parameters, then we need to calculate a separate platform graph for that player.\r\n\r\n![Surfaces in a plattform graph](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/surfaces.png)\r\n\r\n![Edges in a plattform graph](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/edges.png)\r\n\r\n### Nodes: Parsing a Godot `TileMap` into surfaces\r\n\r\n> **NOTE:** The following algorithm assumes that the given `TileMap` only uses tiles with convex collision boundaries.\r\n\r\n#### Parse individual tiles into their constituent surfaces\r\n\r\n-   Map each `TileMap` cell into a polyline that corresponds to the top-side/floor portion of its collision polygon.\r\n    -   Calculate whether the collision polygon's vertices are specified in a clockwise order.\r\n        -   Use this to determine the iteration step size.\r\n            -   `step_size = 1` if clockwise; `step_size = -1` if counter-clockwise.\r\n        -   Regardless of whether the vertices are specified in a clockwise order, we will iterate over them in clockwise order.\r\n    -   Find both the leftmost and rightmost vertices.\r\n    -   Start with the leftmost vertex.\r\n        -   If there is a wall segment on the left side of the polygon, then this vertex is part of it.\r\n        -   If there is no wall segment on the left side of the polygon, then this vertex must be the cusp between a preceding bottom-side/ceiling segment and a following top-side/floor segment (i.e., the previous segment is underneath the next segment).\r\n            -   Even if there is no segment along one side, we store a surface for that side; this surface is only represented by a single point.\r\n    -   Iterate over the following vertices until we find a non-wall segment (this could be the first segment, the one connecting to the leftmost vertex).\r\n        -   Wall segments are distinguished from floor/ceiling segments according to their angle. This is configurable, but typically, a segment up to 45-degrees is a floor/ceiling and a segment steeper than 45-degrees is a wall.\r\n    -   This non-wall segment must be the start of the top-side/floor polyline.\r\n    -   Iterate, adding segments to the result polyline, until we find either a wall segment or the rightmost vertex.\r\n    -   We then also save a mapping from a `TileMap` cell index to each of the different surfaces we've calculated as existing in that cell.\r\n-   Repeat the above process for the right-side, left-side, and bottom-side surfaces.\r\n\r\n#### Remove internal surfaces\r\n\r\n> **NOTE:** This will only detect internal surface segments that are equivalent with another internal segment. But for grid-based tiling systems, this can often be enough.\r\n\r\n-   Check for pairs of floor+ceiling segments or left-wall+right-wall segments, such that both segments share the same vertices.\r\n-   Remove both segments in these pairs.\r\n\r\n#### Merge any connecting surfaces\r\n\r\n-   Iterate across each floor surface A.\r\n-   Nested iterate across each other floor surface B.\r\n    -   Ideally, we should be using a spatial data structure that allows us to only consider nearby surfaces during this nested iteration (such as an R-Tree).\r\n-   Check whether A and B form a \"continuous\" surface.\r\n    -   A and B are both polylines that only have two end points.\r\n    -   Just check whether either endpoint of A equals either endpoint of B.\r\n        -   Actually, our original `TileMap` parsing results in every surface polyline being stored in clockwise order, so we only need to compare the end of A with the start of B and the start of A with the end of B.\r\n-   If they do:\r\n    -   Merge B into A.\r\n    -   Optionally, remove any newly created redundant internal colinear points.\r\n    -   Remove B from the surface collection.\r\n-   Repeat the iteration until no merges were performed.\r\n\r\n#### Record adjacent neighbor surfaces\r\n\r\n-   Every surface should have both adjacent clockwise and counter-clockwise neighbor surfaces.\r\n-   Use a similar process as above for finding surfaces with matching end positions.\r\n\r\n### Edges: Calculating jump movement trajectories\r\n\r\n**tl;dr**: The Surfacer framework uses a procedural approach to calculate trajectories for movement between surfaces. The algorithms used rely heavily on the classic [one-dimensional equations of motion for constant acceleration](https://physics.info/motion-equations/). These trajectories are calculated to match to the same abilities and limitations that are exhibited by corresponding human-controlled movement. After the trajectory for an edge is calculated, it is translated into a simple instruction/input-key start/end sequence that should reproduce the calculated trajectory.\r\n\r\n> **NOTE:** A machine-learning-based approach would probably be a good alternate way to solve this general problem. However, one perk of a procedural approach is that it's relatively easy to understand how it works and to modify it to perform better for any given edge-case (and there are a _ton_ of edge-cases).\r\n\r\n#### The high-level steps\r\n\r\n-   Determine how high we need to jump in order to reach the destination.\r\n-   If the destination is out of reach (vertically or horizontally), ignore it.\r\n-   Calculate how long it will take for vertical motion to reach the destination from the origin.\r\n-   We will define the movement trajectory as a combination of two independent components: a \"vertical step\" and a \"horizontal step\". The vertical step is based primarily on on the jump duration calculated above.\r\n-   Calculate the horizontal step that would reach the destination displacement over the given duration.\r\n-   Check for any unexpected collisions along the trajectory represented by the vertical and horizontal steps.\r\n    -   If there is an intermediate surface that the player would collide with, we need to try adjusting the jump trajectory to go around either side of the colliding surface.\r\n        -   We call these points that movement must go through in order to avoid collisions, \"waypoints\".\r\n        -   Recursively check whether the jump is valid to and from either side of the colliding surface.\r\n        -   If we can't reach the destination when moving around the colliding surface, then try backtracking and consider whether a higher jump height from the start would get us there.\r\n    -   If there is no intermediate collision, then we can calculate the ultimate edge movement instructions for playback based on the vertical and horizontal steps we've calculated.\r\n\r\n#### Some important aspects\r\n\r\n-   We treat horizontal and vertical motion as independent to each other. This greatly simplifies our calculations.\r\n    -   We calculate the necessary jump duration--and from that the vertical component of motion--up-front, and use this to determine times for each potential step and waypoint of the motion. Knowing these times up-front makes the horizontal min/max calculations easier.\r\n-   We have a broad-phase check to quickly eliminate possible surfaces that are obviously out of reach.\r\n    -   This primarily looks at the horizontal and vertical distance from the origin to the destination.\r\n\r\n#### Calculating \"good\" jump and land positions\r\n\r\nDeciding which jump and land positions to base an edge calculation off of is non-trivial. We could just try calculating edges for a bunch of different jump/land positions for a given pair of surfaces. But edge calculations aren't cheap, and executing too many of them impacts performance. So it's important that we carefully choose \"good\" jump/land positions that have a relatively high likelihood of producing a valid and efficient edge.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when jumping from a floor, we need to determine what initial horizontal velocity to use for the edge calculation. This horizontal start velocity can then influence the jump/land positions.\r\n\r\n-   Some interesting jump/land positions for a surface include the following:\r\n    -   Either end of the surface.\r\n    -   The closest position along the surface to either end of the other surface.\r\n        -   This closest position, but with a slight offset to account for the width of the player.\r\n        -   This closest position, but with an additional offset to account for horizontal or vertical displacement with minimum jump time and maximum horizontal velocity.\r\n            -   This offset becomes important when considering jumps that start with max-speed horizontal velocity, which could otherwise overshoot the land position if we didn't account for the offset.\r\n    -   The closest interior position along the surface to the closest interior position along the other surface.\r\n    -   The position along a horizontal surface that is behind the overall connected region that the vertical land surface is a part of.\r\n        -   This position is important if we need to consider movement around behind a wall that then lands on the top of the wall.\r\n-   We try to minimize the number of jump/land positions returned, since having more of these greatly increases the overall time to parse the platform graph.\r\n-   We usually consider surface-interior points before surface-end points (which usually puts shortest distances first).\r\n-   We also decide start velocity when we decide the jump/land positions.\r\n    -   We only ever consider start velocities with zero or max speed.\r\n-   Additionally, we often quit early as soon as we've calculated the first valid edge for a given pair of surfaces.\r\n    -   In order to decide whether to skip an edge calculation for a given jump/land position pair, we look at how far away it is from any other jump/land position pair that we already found a valid edge for, on the same surface, for the same surface pair. If it's too close, we skip it.\r\n    -   This is another important performance optimization.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most jump/land position calculations are highly dependent on the types and spatial arrangement of the two surfaces. There are many possible combinations, and the most of these combinations must be considered individually. The following diagrams illustrate the many different jump/land combinations.\r\n\r\n![A legend for the illustrations of jump-land-position combinations](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/jump-land-positions-legend.png)\r\n\r\n![Illustrations of floor-to-floor jump-land-position combinations](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/jump-land-positions-floor-to-floor.png)\r\n\r\n![Illustrations of floor-to-wall jump-land-position combinations](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/jump-land-positions-floor-to-wall.png)\r\n\r\n![Illustrations of wall-to-floor jump-land-position combinations](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/jump-land-positions-wall-to-floor.png)\r\n\r\n![Illustrations of wall-to-opposite-facing-wall jump-land-position combinations](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/jump-land-positions-wall-to-opposite-wall.png)\r\n\r\n![Illustrations of wall-to-same-facing-wall jump-land-position combinations](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/jump-land-positions-wall-to-same-wall.png)\r\n\r\n![Illustrations of floor-to-ceiling jump-land-position combinations](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/jump-land-positions-floor-to-ceiling.png)\r\n\r\n#### Calculating the start velocity for a jump\r\n\r\n-   In the general case, we can't know at build-time what direction along a surface the player will\r\n    be moving from when they need to start a jump.\r\n-   Unfortunately, using start velocity x values of zero for all jump edges tends to produce very\r\n    unnatural composite trajectories (similar to using perpendicular Manhatten distance routes\r\n    instead of more diagonal routes).\r\n-   So, we can assume that for surface-end jump-off positions, we'll be approaching the jump-off\r\n    point from the center of the edge.\r\n-   And for most edges we should have enough run-up distance in order to hit max horizontal speed\r\n    before reaching the jump-off point--since horizontal acceleration is relatively quick.\r\n-   Also, we only ever consider velocity-start values of zero or max horizontal speed. Since the\r\n    horizontal acceleration is quick, most jumps at run time shouldn't need some medium-speed. And\r\n    even if they did, we force the initial velocity of the jump to match expected velocity, so the\r\n    jump trajectory should proceed as expected, and any sudden change in velocity at the jump start\r\n    should be acceptably small.\r\n\r\n#### Calculating the total jump duration (and the vertical step for the edge)\r\n\r\n-   At the start of each edge-calculation traversal, we calculate the minimum total time needed to reach the destination.\r\n    -   If the destination is above, this might be the time needed to rise that far in the jump.\r\n    -   If the destination is below, this might be the time needed to fall that far (still taking into account any initial upward jump-off velocity).\r\n    -   If the destination is far away horizontally, this might be the time needed to move that far horizontally (taking into account the horizontal movement acceleration and max speed).\r\n    -   The greatest of these three possibilities is the minimum required total duration of the jump.\r\n-   The minimum peak jump height can be determined from this total duration.\r\n-   All of this takes into account our variable-height jump mechanic and the difference in slow-ascent and fast-fall gravities.\r\n    -   With our variable-height jump mechanic, there is a greater acceleration of gravity when the player either is moving downward or has released the jump button.\r\n    -   If the player releases the jump button before reaching the maximum peak of the jump, then their current velocity will continue pushing them upward, but with the new stronger gravity.\r\n    -   To determine the duration to the jump peak height in this scenario, we first construct two instances of one of the basic equations of motion--one for the former part of the ascent, with the slow-ascent gravity, and one for the latter part of the ascent, with the fast-fall gravity. We then use algebra to substitute the equations and solve for the duration.\r\n\r\n#### Calculating the horizontal steps in an edge\r\n\r\n-   If we decide whether a surface could be within reach, we then check for possible collisions between the origin and destination.\r\n    -   To do this, we simulate frame-by-frame motion using the same physics timestep and the same movement-update function calls that would be used when running the game normally. We then check for any collisions between each frame.\r\n-   If we detect a collision, then we define two possible \"waypoints\"--one for each end of the collided surface.\r\n    -   In order to make it around this intermediate surface, we know the player must pass around one of the ends of this surface.\r\n    -   These waypoints we calculate represent the minimum required deviation from the player's original path.\r\n-   We then recursively check whether the player could move to and from each of the waypoints.\r\n    -   We keep the original vertical step and overall duration the same.\r\n    -   We can use that to calculate the time and vertical state that must be used for the waypoint.\r\n    -   Then we only really consider whether the horizontal movement could be valid within the the given time limit.\r\n-   If so, we concatenate and return the horizontal steps required to reach the waypoint from the original starting position and the horizontal steps required to reach the original destination from the waypoint.\r\n\r\n#### Backtracking to consider a higher max jump height\r\n\r\n-   Sometimes, a waypoint may be out of reach, when we're calculating horizontal steps, given the current step's starting position and velocity.\r\n-   However, maybe the waypoint could be within reach, if we had originally jumped a little higher.\r\n-   To account for this, we backtrack to the start of the overall movement traversal and consider whether a higher jump could reach the waypoint.\r\n    -   The destination waypoint is first updated to support a new jump height that would allow for a previously-out-of-reach intermediate waypoint to also be reached.\r\n    -   Then all steps are re-calculated from the start of the movement, while considering the new destination state.\r\n-   If it could, we return that result instead.\r\n\r\n#### Waypoint calculations\r\n\r\n-   We calculate waypoints before steps.\r\n    -   We calculate a lot of state to store on them, and then depend on this state during step calculation.\r\n    -   Some of this state includes:\r\n        -   The time for passing through the waypoint (corresponding to the overall jump height and edge duration).\r\n        -   The horizontal direction of movement through the waypoint (according to the direction of travel from the previous waypoint or according to the direction of the surface).\r\n        -   The min and max possible x-velocity when the movement passes through this waypoint.\r\n            -   With a higher speed through a waypoint, we could reach further for the next waypoint, or we could be stuck overshooting the next waypoint. So it's useful to calculate the range of possible horizontal velocities through a waypoint.\r\n        -   The actual x-velocity for movement through the waypoint is calculated later when calculating the cooresponding movement step.\r\n            -   We typically try to use an x-velocity that will minimize speed through the waypoint, while still satisfying the horizontal step displacement and the waypoint's min/max limitations.\r\n-   Here's the sequence of events for waypoint calculations:\r\n    -   Start by calculating origin and destination waypoints.\r\n        -   For the origin waypoint, min, max, and actual x-velocity are all zero.\r\n        -   For the destination waypoint, min and max are assigned according to how acceleration can be applied during the step (e.g., at the start or at the end of the interval).\r\n    -   Then, during step calculation traversal, when a new intermediate waypoint is created, its min and max x-velocity are assigned according to both the min and max x-velocity of the following waypoint and the actual displacement and duration of the step from the new waypoint to the next waypoint.\r\n    -   Intermediate waypoints are calculated with pre-order tree traversal.\r\n      -   This poses a small problem:\r\n        -   The calculation of a waypoint depends on the accuracy of the min/max x-velocity of it's next waypoint.\r\n        -   However, the min/max x-velocity of the next waypoint could need to be updated if it in turn has a new next waypoint later on.\r\n        -   Additionally, a new waypoint could be created later on that would become the new next waypoint instead of the old next waypoint.\r\n        -   To ameliorate this problem, everytime a new waypoint is created, we update its immediate neighbor waypoints.\r\n        -   These updates do not solve all cases, since we may in turn need to update the min/max x-velocities and movement sign for all other waypoints. And these updates could then result in the addition/removal of other intermediate waypoints. But we have found that these two updates are enough for most cases. If we detect that a neigbor waypoint would be invalidated during an update, we abandon the edge calculation, which could result in a false-negative result.\r\n    -   Steps are calculated with in-order tree traversal (i.e., in the same order they'd be executed when moving from origin to destination).\r\n\r\n#### Fake waypoints\r\n\r\n-   When calcuting steps to navigate around a collision with a ceiling or floor surface, sometimes one of the two possible waypoints is what we call \"fake\".\r\n-   A fake waypoint corresponds to the left side of the floor/ceiling surface when movement from the previous waypoint is rightward (or to the right side when movement is leftward).\r\n-   In this case, movement will need to go around both the floor/ceiling as well as its adjacent wall surface.\r\n-   The final movement trajectory should not end-up moving through the fake waypoint.\r\n-   The actual waypoint that the final movement should move through, is instead the \"real\" waypoint that cooresponds to the far edge of this adjacent wall surface.\r\n-   So, when we find a fake waypoint, we immediately replace it with its adjacent real waypoint.\r\n-   Example scenario:\r\n  -   Origin is waypoint #0, Destination is waypoint #3\r\n  -   Assume we are jumping from a low-left platform to a high-right platform, and there is an intermediate block in the way.\r\n  -   Our first step attempt hits the underside of the block, so we try waypoints on either side.\r\n  -   After trying the left-hand waypoint (#1), we then hit the left side of the block. So we then try a top-side waypoint (#2).\r\n      -   (Bottom-side fails the surface-already-encountered check).\r\n  -   After going through this new left-side (right-wall), top-side waypoint (#2), we can successfully reach the destination.\r\n  -   With the resulting scenario, we shouldn't actually move through both of the intermediate waypoints (#1 and #2). We should should instead skip the first intermediate waypoint (#1) and go straight from the origin to the second intermediate waypoint (#2).\r\n\r\n> TODO: screenshot of example scenario\r\n\r\n#### Collision calculation madness\r\n\r\n**tl;dr**: Godot's collision-detection engine is very broken. We try to make it work for our\r\npathfinding, but there are still false negatives and rough edges.\r\n\r\nHere's a direct quote from a comment in Godot's underlying collision-calculation logic:\r\n\r\n> give me back regular physics engine logic<br>\r\n> this is madness<br>\r\n> and most people using this function will think<br>\r\n> what it does is simpler than using physics<br>\r\n> this took about a week to get right..<br>\r\n> but is it right? who knows at this point..<br>\r\n\r\n(https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/a7f49ac9a107820a62677ee3fb49d38982a25165/servers/physics_2d/space_2d_sw.cpp#L692)\r\n\r\nSome known limitations and rough edges include:\r\n-   When a [`KinematicBody2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_kinematicbody2d.html) is sliding around a corner of another collidable, Godot can sometimes calculate the wrong results (oppositite direction) for `is_floor()`/`is_ceiling()`.\r\n-   Inconsistency between the behavior of the [`KinematicBody2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_kinematicbody2d.html) and [`Physics2DDirectSpaceState`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_physics2ddirectspacestate.html) collision APIs.\r\n    -   We were originally using the Physics2DDirectSpaceState for most of our graph calculations. However, this API seems to be more broken than the KinematicBody2D API. Also, we're using the KinematicBody2D API at run time, so we see more consistent results by using the KinematicBody2D API at build time as well.\r\n\r\n### Navigator: Using the platform graph to move from A to B\r\n\r\nOnce the platform graph has been parsed, finding and moving along a path through the graph is relatively straight-forward. The sequence of events looks like the following:\r\n\r\n-   Given a target point to navigate towards and the player's current position.\r\n-   Find the closest point along the closest surface to the target point.\r\n-   Use A* search to find a path through the graph from the origin to the destination.\r\n    -   We can use distance or duration as the edge weights.\r\n-   Execute playback of the instruction set for each edge of the path, in sequence.\r\n\r\n![Navigator finding a path to a destination](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/navigator-preselection.png)\r\n\r\n#### Dynamic edge optimization according to runtime approach\r\n\r\nAt runtime, after finding a path through build-time-calculated edges, we try to optimize the jump-off points of the edges to better account for the direction that the player will be approaching the edge from. This produces more efficient and natural movement. The build-time-calculated edge state would only use surface end-points or closest points. We also take this opportunity to update start velocities to exactly match what is allowed from the ramp-up distance along the edge, rather than either the fixed zero or max-speed value used for the build-time-calculated edge state.\r\n\r\n#### Edge instructions playback\r\n\r\nWhen we create the edges, we represent the movement trajectories according to the sequence of instructions that would produce the trajectory. Each instruction is simply represented by an ID for the relevant input key, whether the key is being pressed or released, and the time. The player movement system can then handle these input key events in the same way as actual human-triggered input key events.\r\n\r\n#### Correcting for runtime vs buildtime trajectory discrepancies\r\n\r\nWhen executing edge instructions, the resulting run-time trajectory is usually slightly off from the expected trajectory that was pre-calculated when creating the edge. This variance is usually pretty minor, but, just in case, a given player can be configured to use the exact pre-calculated edge trajectory rather than the run-time version.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, this discrepancy shouldn't exist, and we should be able to eliminate it at some point.\r\n\r\n## Platform graph inspector\r\n\r\nAs you might imagine, the calculations for these edges can get quite complicated. To make these calculations easier to understand and debug, we created a powerful platform graph inspector. This can be accessed from the inspector panel (the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen).\r\n\r\n![Platform graph inspector](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/platform-graph.png)\r\n\r\nThe inspector is a tree-view widget with the following structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n - Platform graph [player_name]\r\n   - Edges [#]\r\n     - [#] Edges calculated with increasing jump height\r\n       - JUMP_INTER_SURFACE_EDGEs [#]\r\n         - [(x,y), (x,y)]\r\n           - Profiler\r\n             - ...\r\n           - EDGE_VALID_WITH_INCREASING_JUMP_HEIGHT [1]\r\n             - 1: Movement is valid.\r\n             - ...\r\n         - ...\r\n       - ...\r\n     - [#] Edges calculated without increasing jump height\r\n       - ...\r\n     - [#] Edges calculated with one step\r\n       - ...\r\n   - Surfaces [#]\r\n     - FLOORs [#]\r\n       - [(x,y), (x,y)]\r\n         - _# valid outbound edges_\r\n         - _Destination surfaces:_\r\n         - FLOOR [(x,y), (x,y)]\r\n           - JUMP_INTER_SURFACE_EDGEs [#]\r\n             - [(x,y), (x,y)]\r\n               - Profiler\r\n                 - ...\r\n               - EDGE_VALID_WITH_INCREASING_JUMP_HEIGHT [1]\r\n                 - 1: Movement is valid.\r\n                 - ...\r\n             - ...\r\n             - Failed edge calculations [#]\r\n               - REASON_FOR_FAILING [(x,y), (x,y)]\r\n                 - Profiler\r\n                   - ...\r\n                 - REASON_FOR_FAILING [#]\r\n                   - 1: Step result info\r\n                     - 2: Step result info\r\n                     - ...\r\n                   - ...\r\n                 - ...\r\n               - ...\r\n           - ...\r\n         - ...\r\n       - ...\r\n     - ...\r\n   - Profiler\r\n     - ...\r\n     - Global counts\r\n       - # total surfaces\r\n       - # total edges\r\n       - # JUMP_INTER_SURFACE_EDGEs\r\n       - ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach entry in this inspector tree is encoded with annotation information which will render debugging info over the level for the corresponding entity. Additionally, each entry contains a detailed description. These are both shown when selecting the entry.\r\n\r\n![Edge-step calculation debugging annotation](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/surfacer/edge-step-calculation-debugging.png)\r\n\r\n## Annotators\r\n\r\nWe include a large collection of annotators that are useful for visually debugging calculation of the platform graph. Some of these are rendered by selecting entries in the platform graph inspector and some of them can be toggled through checkboxes in the inspector panel.\r\n\r\n## Movement parameters\r\n\r\nWe support a large number of flags and parameters for adjusting various aspects of player/movement/platform-graph behavior. For a complete list of these params, see [MovementParams.gd](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/surfacer/blob/master/src/platform_graph/edge/models/MovementParams.gd).\r\n\r\n## Extensible framework for custom movement mechanics\r\n\r\n> TODO: Describe this system. For now, look at the code under `src/player/action/action_handlers/` for examples.\r\n\r\n> **NOTE:** The procedural pathfinding logic is implemented independently of this framework. So, you can use this to add cool new movement for human-controlled movement, but the automatic pathfinding will only know about the specific default mechanics that it was designed around.\r\n\r\n## Notable limitations\r\n\r\n-   Our build-time graph calculations take a long time, especially for a level with lots of surfaces (such as a big level, or a level with a small cell size).\r\n-   There is slight discrepancy between discrete and continuous trajectories. The former is what we see from movement produced by the frame-by-frame application of gravity and input actions on the player. The latter is what we see from our precise numerical analysis of algebraic equations when pre-calculating the platform graph. We support a few different techniques for reconciling this:\r\n    -   `MovementParams.syncs_player_velocity_to_edge_trajectory`: When this flag is enabled, the player's run-time _velocity_ will be forced to match the expected pre-calculated (continuous) velocity for the current frame in the currently executing platform graph edge.\r\n    -   `MovementParams.syncs_player_position_to_edge_trajectory`: When this flag is enabled, the player's run-time _position_ will be forced to match the expected pre-calculated (continuous) velocity for the current frame in the currently executing platform graph edge.\r\n    -   `MovementParams.retries_navigation_when_interrupted`: When this flag is enabled, the navigator will re-attempt navigation to the original destination from the current position whenever it detects that the player has hit an unexpected surface, which is what can happen when the run-time discrete trajectories don't match build-time continuous trajectories.\r\n-   When two surfaces face each other and are too close for thte player to fit between (plus a margin of a handful of extra pixels), our graph calculations can produce some false positives.\r\n-   Surfacer doesn't currently fully support surfaces that consist of one point.\r\n-   Our platform graph calculations produce false negatives for some types of jump edge scenarios:\r\n    -   An jump edge that needs to displace the jump position in order to make it around an intermediate waypoint with enough horizontal velocity to then reach the destination.\r\n        -   For example, if the player is jumping from the bottom of a set of stair-like surfaces, the jump position ideally wouldn't be as close as possible to the first rise of the first step (because they can't start accelerating horizontally until vertically clearing the top of the rise). Instead, if the player jumps from a slight offset from the rise, then they can pass over the rise with more speed, which lets them travel further during the jump.\r\n    -   A single horizontal step that needs multiple different sideways-movement instructions (i.e., accelerating to both one side and then the other in the same jump):\r\n        -   For example, backward acceleration in order to not overshoot the end position as well as forward acceleration to then have enough step-end x velocity in order to reach the following waypoint for the next step.\r\n-   Surfacer is opinionated. It requires that you structure your app using TileMaps, specific node groups, and by subclassing certain framework classes in order to create players.\r\n    -   You need to define a set of input actions with the following names (via Project Settings > Input Map):\r\n        -   jump\r\n        -   move_up\r\n        -   move_down\r\n        -   move_left\r\n        -   move_right\r\n        -   dash\r\n        -   zoom_in\r\n        -   zoom_out\r\n        -   pan_up\r\n        -   pan_down\r\n        -   pan_left\r\n        -   pan_right\r\n        -   face_left\r\n        -   face_right\r\n        -   grab_wall\r\n    -   Your level collidable foreground tiles must be defined in a TileMap that belongs to the \"surfaces\" node group.\r\n    -   Surfacer uses a very specific set of movement mechanics.\r\n        -   Fortunately, this set includes most features commonly used in platforms and is able to provide pretty sophisticated movement.\r\n        -   But the procedural path-finding doesn't know about complex platformer mechanics like special in-air friction or coyote time.\r\n    -   The Surfacer framework isn't yet decoupled from the Squirrel Away demo app logic.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n_> **NOTE:** Sadly, the tests are not set up to automatically run on presubmit, so some of the tests are severely out-of-date and broken._\r\n\r\nSurfacer uses the [Gut tool](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) for writing and running unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Licenses\r\n\r\n-   All code is published under the [MIT license](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/surfacer/blob/master/LICENSE).\r\n-   This project depends on various pieces of third-party code that are licensed separately.

You will need to turn off Godot's built-in viewport scaling (`Display > Window > Stretch > Mode = disabled`).\r\n\r\nThis provides some powerful benefits over Godot's standard behaviors, but requires you to be careful with how you define your GUI layouts.\r\n\r\n#### Handling camera zoom\r\n\r\nThis provides limited flexibility in how far the camera is zoomed. That is, you will be able to see more of the level on a larger screen, but not too much more of the level. Similarly, on a wider screen, you will be able to able to see more from side to side, but not too much more.\r\n\r\n-   You can configure a minimum and maximum aspect ratio for the game region.\r\n-   You can configure a default screen size and aspect ratio that the levels are designed around.\r\n-   At runtime, if the current viewport aspect ratio is greater than the max or less than the min, bars will be shown along the sides or top and bottom of the game area.\r\n-   At runtime, the camera zoom will be adjusted so that the same amount of level is showing, either vertically or horizontally, as would be visible with the configured default screen size. If the screen aspect ratio is different than the default, then a little more of the level is visible in the other direction.\r\n-   Any annotations that are drawn in the separate annotations CanvasLayer are automatically transformed to match whatever the game-area's current zoom and position is.\r\n-   Click positions can also be transformed to match the game area.\r\n\r\n#### Handling GUI scale\r\n\r\n-   At runtime, a `gui_scale` value is calculated according to how the current screen resolution compares to the expected default screen resolution, as described above.\r\n-   Then all fonts—which are registered with the scaffold configuration—are resized according to this `gui_scale`.\r\n-   Then the size, position, and scale of all GUI nodes are updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Constraints for how you define your GUI layouts\r\n\r\n> TODO: List any other constraints/tips.\r\n\r\n-   Avoid custom positions, except maybe for centering images. For example:\r\n    -   Instead of encoding a margin/offset, use a VBoxContainer or HBoxContainer parent, and include an empty spacer sibling with size or min-size.\r\n    -   This is especially important when your positioning is calculated to include bottom/right-side margins.\r\n-   Centering images:\r\n    -   To center an image, I often place a `TextureRect` inside of a `Control` inside of some time of auto-positioning container.\r\n    -   I then set the image position in this way: `TextureRect.rect_position = -TextureRect.rect_size/2`.\r\n    -   This wrapper pattern also works well when I need to scale the image.\r\n-   In general, whenever possible, I find it helpful to use a VBoxContainer or HBoxContainer as a parent, and to have children use the shrink-center size flag for both horizontal and vertical directions along with a min-size.\r\n\r\n### Analytics\r\n\r\nThis feature depends on the proprietary third-party **[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/)** service.\r\n\r\n-   Fortunately, Google Analytics is at least free to use.\r\n-   To get started with Google Analytics, [read this doc](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en).\r\n-   To learn more about the \"Measurement Protocol\" API that this class uses to send event info, [read this doc](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1).\r\n-   To learn more about the \"Reporting API\" you could use to run arbitrary queries on your recorded analytics, [read this doc](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4).\r\n    -   Alternatively, you could just use [Google's convenient web client](http://analytics.google.com/).\r\n\r\n#### \"Privacy Policy\" and \"Terms and Conditions\" documents\r\n\r\nIf you intend to record any sort of user data (including app-usage analytics or crash logs), you should create a \"Privacy Policy\" document and a \"Terms and Conditions\" document.

Includes a 3D WebGL-based [graphics framework][grafx], a [physics engine][physx] with 3D rigid-body dynamics and collision detection (with impulse-based resolution), and miscellaneous other features that are commonly needed when creating a game._\r\n\r\n## Grafx: A 3D graphics framework for WebGL\r\n\r\n### Notable features\r\n\r\n- A system for defining 3D shapes, models, and controllers.\r\n- A system for configuring and drawing multiple simultaneous [WebGL programs][webgl-program].\r\n- A system for loading and compiling WebGL shaders and programs.\r\n- Support for both per-model and post-processing shaders. \r\n- A system for loading textures.\r\n- An animation framework.\r\n- A camera framework with built-in first-person and third-person cameras.\r\n- A collection of basic shape definitions, each with vertex position, normal, texture coordinate, and vertex indices configurations.\r\n- Algorithms for converting to and from a vertex-indexing array.\r\n- An algorithm for polygon [tesselation][tesselation].\r\n  - This is used for subdividing all faces of a polygon into a parameterized number of triangles.\r\n  - All of the resulting vertices can then be pushed out to a given radius in order to render a smoother sphere.\r\n- An algorithm for mapping spherical lat-long textures onto an icosahedron.\r\n  - This involves careful consideration of the texture coordinates around the un-even seam of the icosahedron.\r\n\r\n## Physx: A physics engine with 3D rigid-body dynamics and collision detection (with impulse-based resolution).\r\n\r\n### Notable features\r\n\r\n- Includes continuous [collision detection][collision-detection] with [impulse-based resolution][collision-resolution].\r\n- [Decouples the physics simulation and animation rendering time steps][stable-time-steps], and uses a fixed timestep for the physics loop. This provides numerical stability and precise reproducibility.\r\n- Suppresses linear and angular momenta below a certain threshold.\r\n\r\nThe engine consists primarily of a collection of individual physics jobs and an update loop. This update loop is in turn controlled by the animation loop. However, whereas the animation loop renders each job once per frame loop&mdash;regardless of how much time actually elapsed since the previous frame&mdash;the physics loop updates its jobs at a constant rate. To reconcile these frame rates, the physics loop runs as many times as is needed in order to catch up to the time of the current animation frame. The physics frame rate should be much higher than the animation frame rate.\r\n\r\n### Collision Detection\r\n\r\nThis physics engine also includes a collision-detection pipeline. This will detect collisions between collidable bodies and update their momenta in response to the collisions.\r\n\r\n- Consists of an efficient broad-phase collision detection step followed by a precise narrow-phase step.\r\n- Calculates the position, surface normal, and time of each contact.\r\n- Calculates the impulse of a collision and updates the bodies' linear and angular momenta in response.\r\n- Applies Coulomb friction to colliding bodies.\r\n- Sub-divides the time step to more precisely determine when and where a collision occurs.\r\n- Supports multiple collisions with a single body in a single time step.\r\n- Efficiently supports bodies coming to rest against each other.\r\n- Bodies will never penetrate one another.\r\n- This does not address the [tunnelling problem][tunnelling-problem]. That is, it is possible for two fast-moving bodies to pass through each other as long as they did not intersect each other during any time step.\r\n- This only supports collisions between certain types of shapes. Fortunately, this set provides reasonable approximations for most other shapes. The supported types of shapes are:\r\n    - [sphere][sphere]\r\n    - [capsule][capsule]\r\n    - [AABB][aabb]\r\n    - [OBB][obb]\r\n\r\n\r\n[grafx]: https://github.com/levilindsey/grafx\r\n[physx]: https://github.com/levilindsey/physx\r\n\r\n[webgl-program]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLProgram\r\n[tesselation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation\r\n\r\n[collision-detection]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection\r\n[collision-resolution]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_response#Impulse-based_contact_model\r\n[stable-time-steps]: https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/\r\n[tunnelling-problem]: https://www.aorensoftware.com/blog/2011/06/01/when-bullets-move-too-fast/\r\n[sphere]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere\r\n[capsule]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(geometry)\r\n[aabb]: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axis-aligned_bounding_box&redirect=no\r\n[obb]: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oriented_bounding_box&redirect=no\r\n"},{"id":"google-greentea","titleShort":"Google:\nGreentea","titleLong":"Google: Greentea","urls":{"homepage":"https://google.com/about"},"jobTitle":"Software Engineer","location":"Mountain View, CA","date":{"start":"4/2015","end":"12/2016"},"categories":["work","web","frontend","angularjs","dart","angular-2","teamwork"],"images":[{"fileName":"greentea-public-flutter-demo-screenshot.png","description":"This is a public demo screenshot of the Flutter (mobile) version of the Greentea app."}],"videos":[],"content":"_[Google][google-url] is a multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products.

So he made hex-grid.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nSome features of this package include:\r\n\r\n- A particle system complete with neighbor and anchor position spring forces.\r\n- An assortment of **persistent** animations that make the grid _exciting to watch_.\r\n- An assortment of **transient** animations that make the grid _exciting to interact with_.\r\n- A control panel that enables you to adjust most of the many different parameters of this system.\r\n- The ability to display custom collections of posts.\r\n    - These posts will be displayed within individual tiles.\r\n    - These tile posts can be expanded for more information.\r\n    - The contents of these posts use standard [Markdown syntax][markdown-url], which is then parsed by the system for displaying within the grid.\r\n\r\n## The Tile-Expansion Algorithm\r\n\r\nThe following diagrams help to visualize how the grid is expanded.\r\n\r\n### A Basic Sector Expansion\r\n\r\nThis image illustrates how the grid is expanded in order to show an enlarged area with details for a given tile.

For each of these relationships, both the vertical and horizontal grid configurations are illustrated.\r\n\r\nEach tile holds a reference to each of its neighbor tiles. These references are stored in an array that is indexed according to the position of the neighbor tiles relative to the given tile. The left-most images show which positions correspond to which indices.\r\n\r\nThe expanded grid holds an array with references to each of the six sectors. The middle images show which sectors correspond to which indices.\r\n\r\nA sector stores references to its tiles within a two-dimensional array. The right-most images show how this two-dimensional array is indexed.\r\n\r\n![Reference for how neighbor tile and sector data is stored and indexed][indices-image]\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements / Technology Stack\r\n\r\nThe following packages/libraries/projects were used in the development of hex-grid:\r\n\r\n- [Gulp.js][gulp-url]\r\n- [Bower][bower-url]\r\n- [dat.gui][dat-gui-url]\r\n- [Showdown][showdown-url]\r\n- Additional packages that are available via [NPM][npm-url] (these are listed within the `package.json` file)\r\n\r\n\r\n[sector-expansion-1-image]: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/hex-grid/hg-sector-expansion-1.png\r\n[sector-expansion-2-image]: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/hex-grid/hg-sector-expansion-2.png\r\n[indices-image]: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/levi-portfolio-media/hex-grid/hg-indices.png\r\n\r\n[markdown-url]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\r\n[dat-gui-url]: http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui\r\n[gulp-url]: http://gulpjs.com\r\n[bower-url]: http://bower.io\r\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org\r\n[showdown-url]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown\r\n"},{"id":"generator-meanie","titleShort":"MEAN-stack\ngenerator","titleLong":"MEAN-stack Yeoman generator with Gulp","urls":{"npm":"https://npmjs.org/package/generator-meanie","github":"https://github.com/levilindsey/generator-meanie"},"jobTitle":"","location":"","date":{"start":"5/2014","end":"12/2014"},"categories":["side-project","web","mean-stack","frontend","back-end","mongodb","express","angular","node.js","gulp.js","yeoman","npm","library","solo-work"],"images":[{"fileName":"screenshot4.png","description":"This Yeoman generator includes many prompts that help to customize the boilerplate of your application."},{"fileName":"screenshot1.png","description":"The generated project includes gulp tasks to help tackle many common build problems.

Follows the [Best Practice Recommendations for Angular App Structure][angular-best-practices-url], and, in general, attempts to  follow best practices throughout._\r\n\r\n## What this is\r\n\r\n- **Modular**: The main goal of this generator is to create a highly componentized file structure for both  [frontend][angular-best-practices-url] and server-side code. This helps to keep your code modular, scalable, and  easier to understand.\r\n- **Gulp tasks**: This includes a wide array of gulp tasks for optimizing frontend performance and streamlining your  development process.\r\n- **App infrastructure**: This creates a comprehensive boilerplate infrastructure for a end-to-end web application  using the MEAN stack. This likely includes some extra bells and whistles that you may not want to include in your  particular app. The goal of this project is to promote development through _subtractive_ synthesis. What this means  is that, hopefully, this generator creates infrastructure that will handle most of the high-level problems in your  web app, in addition to providing some other common features that you will likely remove.\r\n- **Tests**: This includes a testing infrastructure using the [Karma][karma-url] test runner and the  [Jasmine][jasmine-url] test framework for testing the frontend code.\r\n- **SASS**: This uses the [SASS][sass-url] stylesheet language.\r\n- **UI-Router**: This uses the [UI-Router][ui-router-url] library for more powerful frontend routing and state  management in Angular.\r\n\r\n## Why use this generator instead of one of the many other options?\r\n\r\nMaybe you shouldn't! Check out the file structure, the gulp tasks, and the various libraries and tools that are used   in this project. If these are all aspects that you agree with, then please try this generator out! Otherwise, there  are many other great generators out there for you to use. Addy Osmani has an [excellent article][addy-osmani-url]  describing MEAN-stack development and a quick survey of some of the more popular generators and boilerplate options  for it. Each of these options have different benefits and each option uses a different set of tools.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g generator-meanie\r\nyo meanie\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the [getting set up guide][getting-set-up-url] for a step-by-step walkthrough for setting things up and\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n## Technology stack / acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis project uses technology from a number of third-parties. These technologies include:\r\n\r\n- [Node.js][node-url]\r\n- [AngularJS][angular-url]\r\n- [MongoDB][mongo-url]\r\n- [gulp.js][gulp-url]\r\n- [SASS][sass-url]\r\n- [Yeoman][yeoman-url]\r\n- [Git][git-url]\r\n- Numerous other packages that are available via [NPM][npm-url] (these are listed within the [`package.json`][package.json-url] file)\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis project is an on-going effort to collect common patterns and processes for developing web apps using the MEAN  stack and gulp. It is constantly evolving and gaining new features.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this project is strongly opinionated. This is all code that was originally developed and tested by  Levi for his own personal use.

With this package, each character animates individually, and it is simple to customize this animation.\r\n\r\nThis package is available in the Bower registry as [`text-animation`][bower-url].\r\n\r\n### The In-Order Animation Algorithm\r\n\r\n1. Iterate through each descendant node in the root element's DOM structure  \r\n  a. This uses a pre-order tree traversal\r\n  b. Store the text of each text node along with the parent element and next sibling node associated with the text node\r\n  c. Fix each descendant element with its original dimensions\r\n  d. Empty out all text nodes\r\n2. Iterate through each character and animate them  \r\n  a. This is now a simple linear iteration, because we flattened the DOM structure in our earlier traversal  \r\n  b. Animate the character  \r\n    1. Add the character to a span  \r\n    2. Insert the span into the character's parent element  \r\n      a. If the original text node has a next sibling node, then insert this span before that node  \r\n      b. Otherwise, append this node to the end of the original text node's parent node  \r\n    4. Run the actual animation of the isolated character  \r\n  c. Finish animating the character  \r\n    1. Remove the span  \r\n    2. Concatenate the character back into the original text node  \r\n\r\nThe following three representations of the same DOM structure may help to understand  how this algorithm flattens and stores the DOM representation.\r\n\r\n#### Original HTML Representation\r\n\r\n    <body>\r\n      H\r\n      <p>\r\n        e\r\n      </p>\r\n      y\r\n      <div>\r\n        D\r\n        <p>\r\n          O\r\n        </p>\r\n        M\r\n      </div>\r\n      !\r\n    </body>\r\n\r\n#### Visual Tree Representation\r\n\r\n                                   <body>:Element\r\n          ________________________________|________________________________\r\n         /                /               |               \\                \\\r\n    H:TextNode      <p>:Element      y:TextNode      <div>:Element      !:TextNode\r\n                         |                  _______________|_______________\r\n                     e:TextNode            /               |               \\\r\n                                      D:TextNode      <p>:Element      M:TextNode\r\n                                                           |\r\n                                                       O:TextNode\r\n\r\n#### JavaScript Object Structure of Text Nodes\r\n\r\n    [\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <body>, \"nextSiblingNode\": <p>,   \"text\": \"H\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <p>,    \"nextSiblingNode\": null,  \"text\": \"e\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <body>, \"nextSiblingNode\": <div>, \"text\": \"y\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <div>,  \"nextSiblingNode\": <p>,   \"text\": \"D\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <p>,    \"nextSiblingNode\": null,  \"text\": \"O\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <div>,  \"nextSiblingNode\": null,  \"text\": \"M\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <body>, \"nextSiblingNode\": null,  \"text\": \"!\"}\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\n[main-url]: https://levi.dev/text-animation\r\n[codepen-url]: http://codepen.io/levisl176/full/HGJdF\r\n[bower-url]: http://bower.io/search/?q=text-animation"},{"id":"anvato","titleShort":"Anvato","titleLong":"Anvato","urls":{"homepage":"http://anvato.com"},"jobTitle":"Software Engineer","location":"Mountain View, CA","date":{"start":"10/2013","end":"3/2014"},"categories":["work","web","frontend","android","java","roku","windows-phone","c-sharp","video","teamwork"],"images":[{"fileName":"screenshot1.png","description":"The Anvato web video player."},{"fileName":"screenshot4.png","description":"The Anvato web video player with the preview ribbon open while the user scrubs along the seek bar."},{"fileName":"screenshot5.png","description":"The Anvato web video player with the preview popup open while the user hovers over the seek bar."},{"fileName":"screenshot3.png","description":"The Anvato web video player with the volume control expanded."},{"fileName":"screenshot2.png","description":"The splash screen for the Anvato web video player."}],"videos":[],"content":"_[Anvato][main-url] provides live and on-demand video management, analytics, syndication, and tracking features along with video player SDKs for iOS, Android, and web._\r\n\r\nLevi developed HTTP Live Streaming video-player SDKs for the HTML5, Windows Store, Windows Phone, Roku, and Android platforms to match detailed specifications from clients including Fox, NBC, and Univision.\r\n\r\nThe HTML5 player SDK loaded and played four-times faster than that of Anvato’s leading competitor.\r\n\r\nThe combined Anvato player SDKs drew more than 528,000 viewers per minute during the 2014 SuperBowl, making it the most-viewed single sports event ever delivered online.\r\n\r\nAnvato was acquired by Google in 2016.\r\n\r\n[main-url]: http://anvato.com"},{"id":"progress-circle","titleShort":"Progress\ncircle:\nWeb doodle","titleLong":"Progress circle: A web doodle","urls":{"demo":"https://levi.dev/progress-circle","github":"https://github.com/levilindsey/progress-circle","codepen":"http://codepen.io/levisl176/pen/ndklu"},"jobTitle":"","location":"","date":"2/2014","categories":["side-project","web","doodle","art","frontend","svg","tiny","animation","2D","solo-work"],"images":[{"fileName":"screenshot1.png","description":"The progress circle with its larger radius.

These angles are based off zero degrees along the horizontal axis. The angle value for a point is calculated as the average of the angles of the line segments connecting that point to its previous and next neighbors. These angles are then convoluted with a Gaussian smoothing kernel.\r\n\r\nNext, the given shape instance is uniformly scaled and translated so that its x and y coordinate values range from 0 to 1. It is also translated so that it is centered in this hypothetical, square, 1x1 canvas.\r\n\r\nDirectional pixel values are then computed for the given shape instance. There are four directional components associated with each pixel&mdash;the lines along 0&deg;, 45&deg;, 90&deg;, and 135&deg;. The value of a point for each of these four directions is 1 if the angle is different by 0&deg;, 0 if the angle is different by 45&deg; degrees or more, and linearly interpolated between 0 and 1 for angles differing by 0&deg;-45&deg;. Note that these directions also match with their opposites; i.e., if a point has an angle of 215&deg;, then it has a difference of 0&deg; with the 45&deg; line, and its value for its 45&deg; directional pixel is 1.\r\n\r\nThe entire bitmap region is not stored for each shape instance; in order to save space and time, a mapping from pixel indices to directional intensity values is created, and this mapping contains a key for a given pixel if and only if the shape instance contains a point in that pixel. There are actually four such mappings for each shape instance&mdash; one for each of the four directions. These mappings are created by looping over each of the points, determining in which pixel a point lies, and storing the four directional values of this point at this pixel index within the four mappings. If multiple points in a shape instance have values for the same direction in the same pixel, then the largest value is saved.\r\n\r\nThe discretization of ink means that we have two special cases to consider: when a single pixel contains multiple consecutive points, and when the line segment between two consecutive points intersects a pixel in which neither point actually lies. The former case is actually handled well with the aforementioned policy of saving a pixel's maximal intensity value for each direction. An alternative approach for this could have been to use the average angle values for consecutive points lying within the same pixel, but this causes a good deal of information to be lost within pixels containing high curvature&mdash;i.e., corners. The latter case could be handled robustly by calculating the intermediate pixels via the Bresenham line algorithm, but the lost pixels become less significant with more training examples. Also, a 3x3 Gaussian smoothing kernel is used to smooth the final values of the templates. However, these two points do not address the lost pixels from an unknown shape instance being recognized, and further research could be performed to determine whether the application of the Bresenham line algorithm would increase recognition accuracy.\r\n\r\n#### Training\r\n\r\nAfter each shape instance has been preprocessed, actually creating the templates is a simple process. For each shape class, four complete bitmaps are created&mdash;one for each direction&mdash;and then all of the pixel intensity values for each of the training shape instances are added together into the appropriate bitmaps. Each pixel in each bitmap is then normalized by the number of training instances for the given shape class template. Finally, a 3x3 Gaussian smoothing kernel is used to smooth the final values of each of the directional bitmaps for each template.\r\n\r\n#### Recognition\r\n\r\nTo recognize a given unknown shape instance, a simple distance metric is used, and the shape is classified as whichever class yields the smallest distance. This distance between a shape instance and a class template is computed  as\r\n\r\n![Shape-class distance equation][shape-class-distance-equation-image]\r\n\r\nwhere _I_ is the list of the pixel indices&mdash;i.e., keys&mdash;in the pixel indices to directional intensity values mappings, _s<sub>&theta;i</sub>_ is the directional intensity value from the &theta; directional mapping of the pixel at index _i_ for the unknown shape instance, _t<sub>&theta;i</sub>_ is the directional intensity value from the &theta; directional bitmap of the pixel at index _i_ for the shape class template, _n<sub>s</sub>_ is the number of pixels containing ink for the unknown shape instance, _n<sub>t</sub>_ is the average number of pixels containing ink for the shape class template, and _w_ is a weight parameter.\r\n\r\nThe term relating to the number of pixels containing ink is important, because this distance metric only considers pixels which are covered by the unknown shape instance. To understand why this is a problem, consider the example of the unknown shape instance being the letter P, and there are templates both for the letter P and the letter R. Because the distance only considers the pixels from the shape instance P, the P and R templates will be found to have roughly the same distance. This term for the number of pixels containing ink allows the distance metric to match the P shape instance more closely to the P template than the R template.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that rather than using this term for the number of pixels containing ink, that the distance metric could  simply sum over all of the pixels in the template bitmap rather than only over the pixels covered by the shape  instance, but this leads to its own problem. This would mean that whichever class template contains the least ink&mdash;in our case '-'&mdash;would nearly always be found to have the lowest distance.\r\n\r\n#### Parameters\r\n\r\n_w_ = 0.09\r\ntemplate side length (they are square) = 14\r\nnumber of smoothing iterations for the templates = 3\r\nnumber of smoothing iterations for the point angle values = 1\r\n\r\nThese values have been selected by hand.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nIn order to test this algorithm, a shape collection was compiled from 18 people each drawing 15 shapes 5 times with a few instances being lost due to collection error.\r\n\r\nThen an 18-fold cross-validation was performed with single-user hold outs. The averages from this test are presented in this confusion matrix.\r\n\r\n![Average results][average-results-image]\r\n\r\n_***NOTE: this screen shot should instead say \"18-fold\"**_\r\n\r\n### Strengths\r\n\r\nThe largest strength of this recognition algorithm is that it is extremely fast both to train and to recognize. It took, on average, 0.36 to perform the 18-fold cross-validation, 0.02 seconds to train, and 0.00006 seconds to recognize a shape instance.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm is scale invariant.\r\n\r\n### Weaknesses\r\n\r\nThis algorithm is rotationally variant, so it would not perform well with a system in which rotation mattered.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm does not fully take into account the conditional probabilities of the ink. The templates naturally represent a form of Gaussian probability for ink around a segment of the shape class&mdash;i.e., there is a higher  probability of the ink in an instance of the shape class lying in the center of the segment of the template than off  to either side of the segment. However, given that a point in an instance of the shape class does lie off to one side  of a segment of the shape class template, it is much more likely that the next point also will lie off to that side,  and much less likely that the next point will lie off to the other side. This algorithm does not take advantage of  this conditional probability.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\nThis algorithm could be extended to become rotationally invariant. This could possibly be done by rotating each shape  instance according to an indicative angle from the centroid to the furthest point from the centroid.\r\n\r\nThe conditional ink probability&mdash;addressed in the weaknesses section&mdash;could be taken advantage of with a \"super pixel\" scheme. In this scheme, each pixel in each directional bitmap could contain four additional mxm sub-bitmaps of pixel values. These sub-bitmaps would represent the conditional directional ink probabilities of the neighbors of the given center pixel. Adapting the training of the templates for these bitmaps of super pixels and the distance metric would be a fairly straightforward extension of their current versions. However, this super-pixel scheme would have a much higher time and space complexity.\r\n\r\n### Additional Features\r\n\r\n![Directional bitmaps for the sigma-class template][directional-bitmaps-sigma-template-image]\r\n\r\nThis shows the directional bitmaps for the sigma shape class template.

This route was then displayed on a map with the user’s current location. The user could then rotate the phone around, and the phone would vibrate when pointed in the direction of the current step in the user's route.\r\n\r\nThis involved the creation of a completely novel blind-accessible soft keyboard in addition to the implementation of a database for storing previously entered destinations.\r\n\r\nThe PhoneWand code is open source and online at [http://code.google.com/p/mobileaccessibility/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FPhoneWand][main-url].\r\n\r\n_The following is the final paper from the Phone Wand project._\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe Phone Wand is an Android application for mobile phones that enables a blind user to more easily input and navigate  a walking route. At any time a route has been specified, the phone can hint which direction to walk when the user  requests assistance using the phone's built-in compass and vibration: (1) the user requests for help by double tapping  the \"magic button\" on an orientation screen, (2) the user moves the phone radially to search for the correct direction  and (3) the phone vibrates when facing the correct direction to continue on the route. This type of assistance is  useful when the user is en route to the next intersection and wishes to verify the current heading along the route, or  if the user has reached an intersection and wishes to receive the heading to the next intersection. The application  also contains features to enable blind-users to more easily input and manage walking routes. This includes a custom  blind-accessible keyboard implementation to more easily input addresses, a \"slide-rule\" based blind-accessible list of  previously entered walking routes, and an ability to save your current location as a new future destination. Such  application is useful for blind users navigating noisy, dense, urban city centers where hearing is difficult, the  application's non-verbal orientation guidance is effective, and where location sensing tools are most accurate.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nNavigating routes can be difficult or time consuming for people who are blind or have low-vision. Navigation  applications that are not blind-accessible make it especially difficult and time consuming for blind users to navigate  the software enter route destination. Another problem is that too much text-to-speech can be obstructive to a blind  persons most important sense, hearing, taking away focus from actual navigation and listening for hazards. While  blind-accessible applications often provide an easy interface to input, they often rely too much on text-to-speech  output.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Phone Wand is to minimize text-to-speech related to actual route navigation but keep only the  text-to-speech necessary for a functioning blind-accessible application. The Phone Wand replaces verbal navigation  feedback with vibrational feedback. This is a relatively new type of interaction that uses orientation as input and  vibration as output. The concept is simple, (1) the user points the phone 360 degrees around her and (2) the phone  vibrates when the user is facing the correct direction. This requires minimal text-to-speech as output, solving our  information flooding problem. However, while the heart of our application uses compass and vibration feedback, our  application still relies on text-to-speech for blind-accessible text entry, traditional list of directions display and  giving application directions.\r\n\r\nThe target group for our application includes blind users and low-vision users who can hear. The compass and vibration  feedback portion of our application is theoretically blind-deaf-accessible. But, we assume that our target group can  hear text-to-speech in order to hear application directions and use the touch keyboard to set up routes in our  application. Theoretically we could make the application completely blind-deaf accessible if we had an option to  translate our input and output methods into some standard method familiar for blind-deaf users.\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\n\r\nHarry is walking to a nearby store on the sidewalk and would like additional help. He pulls out his Android phone and  launches the Phone Wand. After patiently inputting the store's destination, and waiting for the phone to compute the  route, he can press the \"magic button\" to enable the compass driven vibrational orientation feedback mode. After  pointing around for a bit, the phone vibrates in the direction he was heading, indicating that he is en route to the  destination. Minutes later he reaches an intersection and is unsure of this next direction of travel. Pressing the  \"magic button\" again, he points the phone around. This time the phone vibrates when he points it to his left. This  indicates that he should turn left. Harry continues this until he reaches the store, where the phone announces that he  has arrived at his destination.\r\n\r\n## Related Work\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of work previously done for inventing useful methods of route-finding and navigation for blind  users. Most of these previous projects are lacking in some regard such as their accuracy, usability, or availability.  There are many projects involving the creation of a novel navigation device, such as the EYECane project, which  involved the creation of a white cane device with an embedded computer and camera, but we will focus rather on blind-accessible smart phone route-finding/navigation applications.\r\n\r\nMost previous work with smart phone applications involves the use of GPS navigating systems with audio feedback  similar to the systems available for driving. The Sendero Group has created a couple of applications that are similar  to our project. Their LookAround application has a user interface that is very similar to ours, but it only provides information on the user's current location; it does not provide route information. Their Mobile Geo application both finds routes and provides information about locations; however, this costs $788, and uses primarily audio feedback. The Iwalk application is another navigation application similar in to ours, but once again, this application's primary method of user feedback was with audio.\r\n\r\nOur application also relies on special accessible methods of text entry and item selection. Our slide rule list item  selection is based upon an earlier project which allows the user to explore the items by pressing a finger on the item and to select it by double tapping it. Our blind accessible touch keyboard was actually invented from scratch and emulates no prior method of text entry; the key is spoken when a finger presses onto it and is selected when a finger is lifted from it. However, a very similar technique for text entry can be seen in how Apple provides iPhone item exploration and selection with their VoiceOver functionality; with VoiceOver, an item is spoken when pressed or slid over and is selected with a second touch on the screen.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Phone Wand application is to provide a blind-accessible interface and orientation scheme for finding and navigating walking routes. Hence the Phone Wand uses the Google Directions API to calculate walking routes using the Android location service including network assisted GPS. Orientation output from the Android sensor service and vibration features are used for orientation feedback. The Android TextToSpeech (TTS) library is heavily used to communicate application screen directions to users in a blind-accessible manner. The Phone Wand automatically saves, previously entered routes and provides the ability to save the current location. The slide rule selection method is used to display these routes for the users and to display a current list of the walking route directions.\r\n\r\n### Destination Input\r\n\r\nThe Phone Wand features a custom blind-accessible keyboard for entering destinations. This keyboard was created to emulate the familiar iPhone keyboard familiar to many blind users. The user uses the keyboard by holding down on the screen and releasing when the desired letter is called. There is functionality for reading out the entered text, backspace, readout of cursor location, and other features. The done button searches for a route best matching the entered text.\r\n\r\nSince blind-accessible text entry is still relatively time consuming for users, the Phone Wand automatically saves previously entered destinations in a list. A user can access this blind-accessible list and select a destination address. The list is based on a Slide Rule interaction technique (cite slide rule paper). A user can scan the list with her finger while the phone speaks back what is currently underneath her finger. If the list is longer than the screen, the user can scan for the \"next\" and \"previous\" buttons in the list to navigate the list. When the user finds the desired item, she can double tap to confirm the item, which the phone will then search for a route.\r\n\r\n### Navigation Features\r\n\r\nAfter a destination has been entered via keyboard or selected from the list of saved addresses, the phone takes the user to a map screen, which displays a route from the current location to the destination. On this screen, there are several options: (1) recompute a new route from the current location, (2) find a nearby address and save it, (3) access a list of directions, or (4) using the compass and vibration feature.\r\n\r\n(1) Recomputing a route is useful when the user is significantly off course from the original route, or otherwise when the user wants to find a fresh route from the current location. The user can accomplish this by swiping upwards. The phone downloads a new route using the Google Directions API.\r\n\r\n(2) Finding a nearby address and saving it is useful when the user wants to \"bookmark\" the current location for future use. This is accomplished by swiping downwards.\r\n\r\n(3) The user can also access a list of directions. The user can swipe right on the map screen to view the list of directions. The list is blind-accessible: it uses the slide rule interaction. Therefore a user can scan through the list and have the phone speak back the directions. This functionality was implemented to give the user another option.\r\n\r\n(4) Finally, the user can take advantage of the compass and vibration feature on this screen as detailed in the next section.\r\n\r\n### Compass and Vibration\r\n\r\nWhile the map screen provides additional features, the compass and vibration mode is the most prominent feature of our application.\r\n\r\nTo activate the compass and vibration mode, the user double taps on the map screen. (This gesture is referred to as the \"magic button\" because it turns this mode on and off.) Afterwards, the user can move the phone radially around her. The phone vibrates when the user is facing the correct direction. The user should double tap on the map screen again to deactivate the mode and continue walking the direction determined by the phone.\r\n\r\nThe intended use of this compass and vibration mode is to check the user's heading at interest points (like intersections) along the route, or whenever the user simply needs to verify her heading. Therefore, the user should activate the mode, check her heading, and then deactivate immediately. While one can activate the mode and leave it enabled throughout the entire route, it may not be accurate enough to direct the user along the route.\r\n\r\nFor effective feedback from the compass, the user should hold the phone parallel to the ground, move the phone radially (point the phone 360 degrees around the person), and move the phone slowly. Since the compass is not entirely accurate, we advise using this feature to \"check\" the heading occasionally along the route, not to depend on it entirely.\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n\r\nWe foresee a few extensions and modifications of the Phone Wand that would be valuable blind and low-vision accessible  applications.\r\n\r\n### Indoor Navigation using RFID Tags\r\n\r\nWillis and Helal's paper \"RFID information grid for blind navigation and wayfinding\" lays out the foundations needed to use and construct an indoor RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based indoor navigation system. RFID tags are cheap, extremely power efficient devices with immense portability that can hold a small amount of information. They are extremely useful in pervasive computing by (literally) attaching computer data to physical objects. Indoor navigation is solved by rigging buildings with thousands of RFIDs each containing a small piece of geographical information. The advantage of RFID readers vs. GPS is in the locality of the information that can be encoded in the RFID. The construction is based on \"mature technology\" so the limiting factors for widespread use of the infrastructure technology is simply economical feasibility and adoption. With demonstrated success in large corporations and college campuses the technology could be come widespread and worked into building code standards.\r\n\r\nIn order for Android to take advantage and drive this potentially navigation changing technology, Android would either need to implement an internal RFID reader or provide some simple cost-effective RFID reader attachment. The limiting factor is hardware. The implications of a Blind indoor navigation tool would be extremely valuable for users to navigate complicated indoor areas with little or no GPS capabilities such as airports, public transportation terminals, malls, and stadiums.\r\n\r\n### Indoor Navigation using RFID Tags\r\n\r\nA useful extension to the Phone Wand would be transferring orientation and vibration feedback to a walking cane via  Bluetooth. A cane is the most natural and useful tool to aid blind people in everyday walking. This extension would  require embedding hardware for compass sensors and vibration directly into a walking cane. There already exists bulky  and expensive electronic aided canes on the market that use sonar to detect solid obstacles and puddles within a \"zone  of safety\". But user feedback indicates these tend to be too expensive or non-functional for practical use. With the  hardware problem solved, a CaneNavigator Android application would allow users to simply enter all route information  into the cell phone, then the Bluetooth would activate, and then the cell phone could be placed in the users pocket.  All information sensing would then be embedded in the cane and then transferred to the cell phone via Bluetooth.  Information would then be processed and vibration signals would transfer from the phone to the cane via Bluetooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[main-url]: http://code.google.com/p/mobileaccessibility/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FPhoneWand"},{"id":"dietary-data-recording-system","titleShort":"Recording\nsystem","titleLong":"Dietary Data Recording System","urls":{"homepage":"http://ee.washington.edu/research/seal","published":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5766890&isnumber=5766834&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D5766890%26isnumber%3D5766834"},"jobTitle":"Student Researcher (Software Engineer)","location":"Seattle, WA","date":{"start":"4/2010","end":"6/2011"},"categories":["work","school","research","android","java","mobile","uw","teamwork"],"images":[{"fileName":"ddrs-app-screenshots.png","description":"A few of the many different screens of the DDRS app."},{"fileName":"meal-review.png","description":"This screen lets the user review all of the different data they recorded for a given meal."},{"fileName":"photo1.jpg","description":"This photo shows the complete device in the process of recording a video of a meal.

Current methods of dietary tracking and assessment typically involve paper and  pencil food diaries and/or periodic dietary interviews, and these tend to be imprecise, yielding inconclusive results  as to how a study participant’s diet affects his or her health. Reasons for this imprecision include participant bias, errors in the participant’s memory, errors in the participant’s judgment of food quantities, and underreporting from the participant. The use of computer technology should be able to remedy many of these problems. This project focuses on creating a device based on mobile phones and hand-held computers to record a participant’s dietary intake. This Dietary Data Recording System (DDRS) will serve as a convenient method for real-time documentation of a participant’s intake, and will allow the participant to record both an audio and a visual description of their food. A fundamental aspect of DDRS is the use of a laser-generated grid of distances in coordination with stereo-optic images for the determination of food volume. This device should provide confirmation as to whether real-time computer-assisted recording of dietary data is manageable and accurate.\r\n\r\n[mamishev-url]: http://ee.washington.edu/faculty/mamishev/\r\n[seal-url]: http://ee.washington.edu/research/seal/\r\n[fred-hutch-url]: http://fredhutch.org/en.html\r\n[paper-url]: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5766890&isnumber=5766834&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D5766890%26isnumber%3D5766834"},{"id":"uw-graphics","titleShort":"OpenGL\nanimations","titleLong":"OpenGL models and animations","urls":{},"jobTitle":"","location":"Seattle, WA","date":"2/2011","categories":["school","uw","opengl","animation","3D","c++","teamwork"],"images":[{"fileName":"screenshot1.png","description":"A screenshot from the program showing a frog playing a ukulele.
