He\r\ndevelops with an emphasis on modular, maintainable, and self-documented code. He takes pride in his work and strives\r\nto design all of his projects to be intuitive and \"easy on the eyes\"&mdash;both from an outward-facing user\r\nperspective and from an internal code-level perspective. He has a passion for design patterns and best practices.\r\n\r\nLevi constantly pushes the envelope with new and exciting ideas for web applications. He thrives on learning new\r\ntechnologies and methodologies with each new project he undertakes.\r\n\r\nLevi is a huge advocate of open-source technology. You can fork all of his side-projects at\r\n[github.com/levilindsey][github-url]!\r\n\r\n## The Bio\r\n\r\nLevi currently works at [Google][google-url] as a Front End Software Engineer.\r\n\r\nLevi is originally from from Olympia, WA. He now lives in Sunnyvale, CA with his wife. She is [a beautiful marine\r\nmammal ecologist][jackie-url] whom he met at the University of Washington in Seattle.\r\n\r\nOutside the realm of computer science, Levi has many hobbies/interests. First and foremost, he is a musician. In\r\naddition to fiddling with various instruments, Levi is a classically trained singer and has led in many operas and\r\nmusicals; some of his more notable performances include: Dido and Aeneas (Aeneas), Savitri (Satyavan), and My Fair\r\nLady (Henry Higgins). While at the University of Washington, Levi studied voice with Thomas Harper. You can hear him\r\nsing beautiful German art songs from his senior recital or twelve a capella songs&mdash;which he arranged, performed,\r\nrecorded, and mixed&mdash;at [ReverbNation][reverb-nation-url].\r\n\r\nSome of his other hobbies include: board games/card games, brewing beer, blacksmithing, and scuba diving.\r\n\r\nLevi was also an Eagle Scout, and spent his highschool summers as a camp counsellor and lifeguard at [Camp\r\nHahobas][camp-hahobas-url], a boy scout camp in Washington state.\r\n\r\n\r\n[github-url]: https://github.com/levilindsey\r\n[google-url]: https://google.com\r\n[jackie-url]: http://www.jackieandlevi.com/jackie\r\n[reverb-nation-url]: http://www.reverbnation.com/levilindsey\r\n[camp-hahobas-url]: http://hahobas.org/"},{"id":"google","titleShort":"Google","titleLong":"Google","urls":{"homepage":"https://google.com"},"jobTitle":"Software Engineer","date":{"start":"4/2015","end":"Present"},"categories":["work","web","front-end","data-driven","angularjs","dart"],"images":[],"videos":[],"content":"_[Google][main-url] is a multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products._\r\n\r\nLevi works for Google in Mountain View as a Software Engineer.

So he made\r\nhex-grid.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nSome features of this package include:\r\n\r\n- A particle system complete with neighbor and anchor position spring forces.\r\n- An assortment of **persistent** animations that make the grid _exciting to watch_.\r\n- An assortment of **transient** animations that make the grid _exciting to interact with_.\r\n- A control panel that enables you to adjust most of the many different parameters of this system.\r\n- The ability to display custom collections of posts.\r\n    - These posts will be displayed within individual tiles.\r\n    - These tile posts can be expanded for more information.\r\n    - The contents of these posts use standard [Markdown syntax][markdown-url], which is then parsed by the system for\r\n      displaying within the grid.\r\n\r\n## The Tile-Expansion Algorithm\r\n\r\nThe following diagrams help to visualize how the grid is expanded.\r\n\r\n### A Basic Sector Expansion\r\n\r\nThis image illustrates how the grid is expanded in order to show an enlarged area with details for a given tile.

These references are stored in an array that is indexed\r\naccording to the position of the neighbor tiles relative to the given tile. The left-most images show which positions\r\ncorrespond to which indices.\r\n\r\nThe expanded grid holds an array with references to each of the six sectors. The middle images show which sectors\r\ncorrespond to which indices.\r\n\r\nA sector stores references to its tiles within a two-dimensional array.

Follows the \r\n[Best Practice Recommendations for Angular App Structure][angular-best-practices-url], and, in general, attempts to \r\nfollow best practices throughout._\r\n\r\n## What this is\r\n\r\n- **Modular**: The main goal of this generator is to create a highly componentized file structure for both \r\n  [front-end][angular-best-practices-url] and server-side code. This helps to keep your code modular, scalable, and \r\n  easier to understand.\r\n- **Gulp tasks**: This includes a wide array of gulp tasks for optimizing front-end performance and streamlining your \r\n  development process.\r\n- **App infrastructure**: This creates a comprehensive boilerplate infrastructure for a end-to-end web application \r\n  using the MEAN stack. This likely includes some extra bells and whistles that you may not want to include in your \r\n  particular app. The goal of this project is to promote development through _subtractive_ synthesis. What this means \r\n  is that, hopefully, this generator creates infrastructure that will handle most of the high-level problems in your \r\n  web app, in addition to providing some other common features that you will likely remove.\r\n- **Tests**: This includes a testing infrastructure using the [Karma][karma-url] test runner and the \r\n  [Jasmine][jasmine-url] test framework for testing the front-end code.\r\n- **SASS**: This uses the [SASS][sass-url] stylesheet language.\r\n- **UI-Router**: This uses the [UI-Router][ui-router-url] library for more powerful front-end routing and state \r\n  management in Angular.\r\n\r\n## Why use this generator instead of one of the many other options?\r\n\r\nMaybe you shouldn't! Check out the file structure, the gulp tasks, and the various libraries and tools that are used \r\nin this project. If these are all aspects that you agree with, then please try this generator out! Otherwise, there \r\nare many other great generators out there for you to use. Addy Osmani has an [excellent article][addy-osmani-url] \r\ndescribing MEAN-stack development and a quick survey of some of the more popular generators and boilerplate options \r\nfor it. Each of these options have different benefits and each option uses a different set of tools.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g generator-meanie\r\nyo meanie\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the [getting set up guide][getting-set-up-url] for a step-by-step walkthrough for setting things up and\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n## Technology stack / acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis project uses technology from a number of third-parties. These technologies include:\r\n\r\n- [Node.js][node-url]\r\n- [AngularJS][angular-url]\r\n- [MongoDB][mongo-url]\r\n- [gulp.js][gulp-url]\r\n- [SASS][sass-url]\r\n- [Yeoman][yeoman-url]\r\n- [Git][git-url]\r\n- Numerous other packages that are available via [NPM][npm-url] (these are listed within the [`package.json`][package.json-url] file)\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis project is an on-going effort to collect common patterns and processes for developing web apps using the MEAN \r\nstack and gulp. It is constantly evolving and gaining new features.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this project is strongly opinionated. This is all code that was originally developed and tested by \r\nLevi for his own personal use. That being said, it works great for him, so it will probably work great for you too!\r\n\r\nFeedback, bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are very welcome!\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n\r\nSee the [project roadmap][roadmap-url] for Levi's future plans for this generator.\r\n\r\n\r\n[flattr-url]: https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=levisl176&url=github.com/levilindsey/generator-meanie&title=generator-meanie&language=javascript&tags=github&category=software\r\n[flattr-image]: http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png\r\n\r\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/generator-meanie\r\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/generator-meanie.svg?style=flat-square\r\n[npm-image-old]: https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-meanie.png\r\n\r\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/levisl176/generator-meanie\r\n[travis-image]: http://img.shields.io/travis/levisl176/generator-meanie/master.svg?style=flat-square\r\n[travis-image-old]: https://secure.travis-ci.org/levisl176/generator-meanie.png?branch=master\r\n\r\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/levisl176/generator-meanie\r\n[coveralls-image]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/levisl176/generator-meanie/master.svg?style=flat-square\r\n[coveralls-image-old]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/levisl176/generator-meanie.svg?style=flat\r\n\r\n[depstat-url]: https://david-dm.org/levisl176/generator-meanie\r\n[depstat-image]: http://img.shields.io/david/levisl176/generator-meanie.svg?style=flat-square\r\n[depstat-image-old]: https://david-dm.org/levisl176/generator-meanie.svg\r\n\r\n[license-url]: https://github.com/levilindsey/generator-meanie/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n[license-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/l/generator-meanie.svg?style=flat-square\r\n\r\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/generator-meanie\r\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/generator-meanie.svg?style=flat-square\r\n\r\n[getting-set-up-url]: https://github.com/levilindsey/generator-meanie/blob/master/docs/getting-set-up.md\r\n[roadmap-url]: https://github.com/levilindsey/generator-meanie/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md\r\n[package.json-url]: https://github.com/levilindsey/generator-meanie/blob/master/package.json\r\n[bower.json-url]: https://github.com/levilindsey/generator-meanie/blob/master/bower.json\r\n\r\n[angular-best-practices-url]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub\r\n[mean-url]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN\r\n[yeoman-url]: http://yeoman.io/\r\n[gulp-url]: http://gulpjs.com/\r\n[node-url]: http://nodejs.org/\r\n[angular-url]: https://angularjs.org/\r\n[mongo-url]: https://mongodb.org/\r\n[sass-url]: http://sass-lang.com/\r\n[git-url]: http://git-scm.com/\r\n[npm-url]: http://npmjs.org/\r\n[bower-url]: http://bower.io/\r\n[traceur-url]: https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler\r\n\r\n[karma-url]: http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html\r\n[jasmine-url]: http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html\r\n[protractor-url]: http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/\r\n[mocha-url]: http://mochajs.org/\r\n[chai-url]: http://chaijs.com/\r\n[sinon-url]: http://sinonjs.org/\r\n\r\n[ui-router-url]: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router\r\n[passport-url]: http://passportjs.org/\r\n\r\n[addy-osmani-url]: http://addyosmani.com/blog/full-stack-javascript-with-mean-and-yeoman/"},{"id":"shouldihaveanother.beer","titleShort":"Web Doodle:\nBeer?","titleLong":"shouldihaveanother.beer","urls":{"demo":"http://shouldihaveanother.beer","github":"https://github.com/levilindsey/shouldihaveanother.beer"},"jobTitle":"","date":"10/2014","categories":["side-project","web","website","doodle","front-end","canvas","animation","gulp.js","tiny"],"images":[{"fileName":"screenshot1.png","description":"This simple web app features randomized delicious beer colors, and delightful animated carbonation."},{"fileName":"screenshot2.png","description":"This simple web app features randomized delicious beer colors, and delightful animated carbonation."},{"fileName":"screenshot3.png","description":"This simple web app features randomized delicious beer colors, and delightful animated carbonation."}],"videos":[],"content":"Levi built and deployed this simple app in a few hours.

These angles are based off\r\nzero degrees along the horizontal axis. The angle value for a point is calculated as the average of the angles of the\r\nline segments connecting that point to its previous and next neighbors. These angles are then convoluted with a\r\nGaussian smoothing kernel.\r\n\r\nNext, the given shape instance is uniformly scaled and translated so that its x and y coordinate values range from 0\r\nto 1. It is also translated so that it is centered in this hypothetical, square, 1x1 canvas.\r\n\r\nDirectional pixel values are then computed for the given shape instance. There are four directional components\r\nassociated with each pixel&mdash;the lines along 0&deg;, 45&deg;, 90&deg;, and 135&deg;. The value of a point for each\r\nof these four directions is 1 if the angle is different by 0&deg;, 0 if the angle is different by 45&deg; degrees or\r\nmore, and linearly interpolated between 0 and 1 for angles differing by 0&deg;-45&deg;. Note that these directions\r\nalso match with their opposites; i.e., if a point has an angle of 215&deg;, then it has a difference of 0&deg; with\r\nthe 45&deg; line, and its value for its 45&deg; directional pixel is 1.\r\n\r\nThe entire bitmap region is not stored for each shape instance; in order to save space and time, a mapping from pixel\r\nindices to directional intensity values is created, and this mapping contains a key for a given pixel if and only if\r\nthe shape instance contains a point in that pixel. There are actually four such mappings for each shape instance&mdash;\r\none for each of the four directions. These mappings are created by looping over each of the points, determining in\r\nwhich pixel a point lies, and storing the four directional values of this point at this pixel index within the four\r\nmappings. If multiple points in a shape instance have values for the same direction in the same pixel, then the\r\nlargest value is saved.\r\n\r\nThe discretization of ink means that we have two special cases to consider: when a single pixel contains multiple\r\nconsecutive points, and when the line segment between two consecutive points intersects a pixel in which neither point\r\nactually lies. The former case is actually handled well with the aforementioned policy of saving a pixel's maximal\r\nintensity value for each direction. An alternative approach for this could have been to use the average angle values\r\nfor consecutive points lying within the same pixel, but this causes a good deal of information to be lost within\r\npixels containing high curvature&mdash;i.e., corners. The latter case could be handled robustly by calculating the\r\nintermediate pixels via the Bresenham line algorithm, but the lost pixels become less significant with more training\r\nexamples. Also, a 3x3 Gaussian smoothing kernel is used to smooth the final values of the templates. However, these\r\ntwo points do not address the lost pixels from an unknown shape instance being recognized, and further research could\r\nbe performed to determine whether the application of the Bresenham line algorithm would increase recognition accuracy.\r\n\r\n#### Training\r\n\r\nAfter each shape instance has been preprocessed, actually creating the templates is a simple process. For each shape\r\nclass, four complete bitmaps are created&mdash;one for each direction&mdash;and then all of the pixel intensity values\r\nfor each of the training shape instances are added together into the appropriate bitmaps. Each pixel in each bitmap is\r\nthen normalized by the number of training instances for the given shape class template. Finally, a 3x3 Gaussian\r\nsmoothing kernel is used to smooth the final values of each of the directional bitmaps for each template.\r\n\r\n#### Recognition\r\n\r\nTo recognize a given unknown shape instance, a simple distance metric is used, and the shape is classified as \r\nwhichever class yields the smallest distance. This distance between a shape instance and a class template is computed \r\nas\r\n\r\n![Shape-class distance equation][shape-class-distance-equation-image]\r\n\r\nwhere _I_ is the list of the pixel indices&mdash;i.e., keys&mdash;in the pixel indices to directional intensity values\r\nmappings, _s<sub>&theta;i</sub>_ is the directional intensity value from the &theta; directional mapping of the pixel\r\nat index _i_ for the unknown shape instance, _t<sub>&theta;i</sub>_ is the directional intensity value from the\r\n&theta; directional bitmap of the pixel at index _i_ for the shape class template, _n<sub>s</sub>_ is the number of\r\npixels containing ink for the unknown shape instance, _n<sub>t</sub>_ is the average number of pixels containing ink\r\nfor the shape class template, and _w_ is a weight parameter.\r\n\r\nThe term relating to the number of pixels containing ink is important, because this distance metric only considers\r\npixels which are covered by the unknown shape instance. To understand why this is a problem, consider the example of\r\nthe unknown shape instance being the letter P, and there are templates both for the letter P and the letter R.\r\nBecause the distance only considers the pixels from the shape instance P, the P and R templates will be found to have\r\nroughly the same distance. This term for the number of pixels containing ink allows the distance metric to match the P\r\nshape instance more closely to the P template than the R template.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that rather than using this term for the number of pixels containing ink, that the distance metric could \r\nsimply sum over all of the pixels in the template bitmap rather than only over the pixels covered by the shape \r\ninstance, but this leads to its own problem. This would mean that whichever class template contains the least\r\nink&mdash;in our case '-'&mdash;would nearly always be found to have the lowest distance.\r\n\r\n#### Parameters\r\n\r\n_w_ = 0.09\r\ntemplate side length (they are square) = 14\r\nnumber of smoothing iterations for the templates = 3\r\nnumber of smoothing iterations for the point angle values = 1\r\n\r\nThese values have been selected by hand.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nIn order to test this algorithm, a shape collection was compiled from 18 people each drawing 15 shapes 5 times with a\r\nfew instances being lost due to collection error.\r\n\r\nThen an 18-fold cross-validation was performed with single-user hold outs. The averages from this test are presented\r\nin this confusion matrix.\r\n\r\n![Average results][average-results-image]\r\n\r\n_***NOTE: this screen shot should instead say \"18-fold\"**_\r\n\r\n### Strengths\r\n\r\nThe largest strength of this recognition algorithm is that it is extremely fast both to train and to recognize. It \r\ntook, on average, 0.36 to perform the 18-fold cross-validation, 0.02 seconds to train, and 0.00006 seconds to \r\nrecognize a shape instance.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm is scale invariant.\r\n\r\n### Weaknesses\r\n\r\nThis algorithm is rotationally variant, so it would not perform well with a system in which rotation mattered.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm does not fully take into account the conditional probabilities of the ink. The templates naturally \r\nrepresent a form of Gaussian probability for ink around a segment of the shape class&mdash;i.e., there is a higher \r\nprobability of the ink in an instance of the shape class lying in the center of the segment of the template than off \r\nto either side of the segment. However, given that a point in an instance of the shape class does lie off to one side \r\nof a segment of the shape class template, it is much more likely that the next point also will lie off to that side, \r\nand much less likely that the next point will lie off to the other side. This algorithm does not take advantage of \r\nthis conditional probability.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\nThis algorithm could be extended to become rotationally invariant. This could possibly be done by rotating each shape \r\ninstance according to an indicative angle from the centroid to the furthest point from the centroid.\r\n\r\nThe conditional ink probability&mdash;addressed in the weaknesses section&mdash;could be taken advantage of with a\r\n\"super pixel\" scheme. In this scheme, each pixel in each directional bitmap could contain four additional mxm\r\nsub-bitmaps of pixel values. These sub-bitmaps would represent the conditional directional ink probabilities of the\r\nneighbors of the given center pixel. Adapting the training of the templates for these bitmaps of super pixels and the\r\ndistance metric would be a fairly straightforward extension of their current versions. However, this super-pixel\r\nscheme would have a much higher time and space complexity.\r\n\r\n### Additional Features\r\n\r\n![Directional bitmaps for the sigma-class template][directional-bitmaps-sigma-template-image]\r\n\r\nThis shows the directional bitmaps for the sigma shape class template.

Reasons for this imprecision include participant bias,\r\nerrors in the participantâ€™s memory, errors in the participantâ€™s judgment of food quantities, and underreporting from\r\nthe participant. The use of computer technology should be able to remedy many of these problems. This project focuses\r\non creating a device based on mobile phones and hand-held computers to record a participantâ€™s dietary intake. This\r\nDietary Data Recording System (DDRS) will serve as a convenient method for real-time documentation of a participantâ€™s\r\nintake, and will allow the participant to record both an audio and a visual description of their food. A fundamental\r\naspect of DDRS is the use of a laser-generated grid of distances in coordination with stereo-optic images for the\r\ndetermination of food volume. This device should provide confirmation as to whether real-time computer-assisted\r\nrecording of dietary data is manageable and accurate.\r\n\r\n[mamishev-url]: http://ee.washington.edu/faculty/mamishev/\r\n[seal-url]: http://ee.washington.edu/research/seal/\r\n[fred-hutch-url]: http://fredhutch.org/en.html\r\n[paper-url]: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5766890&isnumber=5766834&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D5766890%26isnumber%3D5766834"},{"id":"phone-wand","titleShort":"Blind-\nAccessible\nNavigation","titleLong":"Phone Wand","urls":{"googleCode":"https://code.google.com/p/mobileaccessibility/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FPhoneWand"},"jobTitle":"","date":{"start":"4/2011","end":"6/2011"},"categories":["school","research","uw","android","java","accessibility","google-maps-api","app"],"images":[{"fileName":"fixedinputscreen2.png","description":"This screen presents the current destination.

This route was then displayed on a map with the userâ€™s\r\ncurrent location. The user could then rotate the phone around, and the phone would vibrate when pointed in the\r\ndirection of the current step in the user's route.\r\n\r\nThis involved the creation of a completely novel blind-accessible soft keyboard in addition to the implementation of a\r\ndatabase for storing previously entered destinations.\r\n\r\nThe PhoneWand code is open source and online at\r\n[http://code.google.com/p/mobileaccessibility/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FPhoneWand][main-url].\r\n\r\n_The following is the final paper from the Phone Wand project._\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe Phone Wand is an Android application for mobile phones that enables a blind user to more easily input and navigate \r\na walking route. At any time a route has been specified, the phone can hint which direction to walk when the user \r\nrequests assistance using the phone's built-in compass and vibration: (1) the user requests for help by double tapping \r\nthe \"magic button\" on an orientation screen, (2) the user moves the phone radially to search for the correct direction \r\nand (3) the phone vibrates when facing the correct direction to continue on the route. This type of assistance is \r\nuseful when the user is en route to the next intersection and wishes to verify the current heading along the route, or \r\nif the user has reached an intersection and wishes to receive the heading to the next intersection. The application \r\nalso contains features to enable blind-users to more easily input and manage walking routes. This includes a custom \r\nblind-accessible keyboard implementation to more easily input addresses, a \"slide-rule\" based blind-accessible list of \r\npreviously entered walking routes, and an ability to save your current location as a new future destination. Such \r\napplication is useful for blind users navigating noisy, dense, urban city centers where hearing is difficult, the \r\napplication's non-verbal orientation guidance is effective, and where location sensing tools are most accurate.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nNavigating routes can be difficult or time consuming for people who are blind or have low-vision. Navigation \r\napplications that are not blind-accessible make it especially difficult and time consuming for blind users to navigate \r\nthe software enter route destination. Another problem is that too much text-to-speech can be obstructive to a blind \r\npersons most important sense, hearing, taking away focus from actual navigation and listening for hazards. While \r\nblind-accessible applications often provide an easy interface to input, they often rely too much on text-to-speech \r\noutput.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Phone Wand is to minimize text-to-speech related to actual route navigation but keep only the \r\ntext-to-speech necessary for a functioning blind-accessible application. The Phone Wand replaces verbal navigation \r\nfeedback with vibrational feedback. This is a relatively new type of interaction that uses orientation as input and \r\nvibration as output. The concept is simple, (1) the user points the phone 360 degrees around her and (2) the phone \r\nvibrates when the user is facing the correct direction. This requires minimal text-to-speech as output, solving our \r\ninformation flooding problem. However, while the heart of our application uses compass and vibration feedback, our \r\napplication still relies on text-to-speech for blind-accessible text entry, traditional list of directions display and \r\ngiving application directions.\r\n\r\nThe target group for our application includes blind users and low-vision users who can hear. The compass and vibration \r\nfeedback portion of our application is theoretically blind-deaf-accessible. But, we assume that our target group can \r\nhear text-to-speech in order to hear application directions and use the touch keyboard to set up routes in our \r\napplication. Theoretically we could make the application completely blind-deaf accessible if we had an option to \r\ntranslate our input and output methods into some standard method familiar for blind-deaf users.\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\n\r\nHarry is walking to a nearby store on the sidewalk and would like additional help. He pulls out his Android phone and \r\nlaunches the Phone Wand. After patiently inputting the store's destination, and waiting for the phone to compute the \r\nroute, he can press the \"magic button\" to enable the compass driven vibrational orientation feedback mode. After \r\npointing around for a bit, the phone vibrates in the direction he was heading, indicating that he is en route to the \r\ndestination. Minutes later he reaches an intersection and is unsure of this next direction of travel. Pressing the \r\n\"magic button\" again, he points the phone around. This time the phone vibrates when he points it to his left. This \r\nindicates that he should turn left. Harry continues this until he reaches the store, where the phone announces that he \r\nhas arrived at his destination.\r\n\r\n## Related Work\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of work previously done for inventing useful methods of route-finding and navigation for blind \r\nusers. Most of these previous projects are lacking in some regard such as their accuracy, usability, or availability. \r\nThere are many projects involving the creation of a novel navigation device, such as the EYECane project, which \r\ninvolved the creation of a white cane device with an embedded computer and camera, but we will focus rather on\r\nblind-accessible smart phone route-finding/navigation applications.\r\n\r\nMost previous work with smart phone applications involves the use of GPS navigating systems with audio feedback \r\nsimilar to the systems available for driving. The Sendero Group has created a couple of applications that are similar \r\nto our project. Their LookAround application has a user interface that is very similar to ours, but it only provides\r\ninformation on the user's current location; it does not provide route information. Their Mobile Geo application both\r\nfinds routes and provides information about locations; however, this costs $788, and uses primarily audio feedback.\r\nThe Iwalk application is another navigation application similar in to ours, but once again, this application's primary\r\nmethod of user feedback was with audio.\r\n\r\nOur application also relies on special accessible methods of text entry and item selection. Our slide rule list item \r\nselection is based upon an earlier project which allows the user to explore the items by pressing a finger on the item\r\nand to select it by double tapping it. Our blind accessible touch keyboard was actually invented from scratch and\r\nemulates no prior method of text entry; the key is spoken when a finger presses onto it and is selected when a finger\r\nis lifted from it. However, a very similar technique for text entry can be seen in how Apple provides iPhone item\r\nexploration and selection with their VoiceOver functionality; with VoiceOver, an item is spoken when pressed or slid\r\nover and is selected with a second touch on the screen.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Phone Wand application is to provide a blind-accessible interface and orientation scheme for\r\nfinding and navigating walking routes. Hence the Phone Wand uses the Google Directions API to calculate walking routes\r\nusing the Android location service including network assisted GPS. Orientation output from the Android sensor service\r\nand vibration features are used for orientation feedback. The Android TextToSpeech (TTS) library is heavily used to\r\ncommunicate application screen directions to users in a blind-accessible manner. The Phone Wand automatically saves,\r\npreviously entered routes and provides the ability to save the current location. The slide rule selection method is\r\nused to display these routes for the users and to display a current list of the walking route directions.\r\n\r\n### Destination Input\r\n\r\nThe Phone Wand features a custom blind-accessible keyboard for entering destinations. This keyboard was created to\r\nemulate the familiar iPhone keyboard familiar to many blind users. The user uses the keyboard by holding down on the\r\nscreen and releasing when the desired letter is called. There is functionality for reading out the entered text,\r\nbackspace, readout of cursor location, and other features. The done button searches for a route best matching the\r\nentered text.\r\n\r\nSince blind-accessible text entry is still relatively time consuming for users, the Phone Wand automatically saves\r\npreviously entered destinations in a list. A user can access this blind-accessible list and select a destination\r\naddress. The list is based on a Slide Rule interaction technique (cite slide rule paper). A user can scan the list\r\nwith her finger while the phone speaks back what is currently underneath her finger. If the list is longer than the\r\nscreen, the user can scan for the \"next\" and \"previous\" buttons in the list to navigate the list. When the user finds\r\nthe desired item, she can double tap to confirm the item, which the phone will then search for a route.\r\n\r\n### Navigation Features\r\n\r\nAfter a destination has been entered via keyboard or selected from the list of saved addresses, the phone takes the\r\nuser to a map screen, which displays a route from the current location to the destination. On this screen, there are\r\nseveral options: (1) recompute a new route from the current location, (2) find a nearby address and save it, (3)\r\naccess a list of directions, or (4) using the compass and vibration feature.\r\n\r\n(1) Recomputing a route is useful when the user is significantly off course from the original route, or otherwise when\r\nthe user wants to find a fresh route from the current location. The user can accomplish this by swiping upwards. The\r\nphone downloads a new route using the Google Directions API.\r\n\r\n(2) Finding a nearby address and saving it is useful when the user wants to \"bookmark\" the current location for future\r\nuse. This is accomplished by swiping downwards.\r\n\r\n(3) The user can also access a list of directions. The user can swipe right on the map screen to view the list of\r\ndirections. The list is blind-accessible: it uses the slide rule interaction. Therefore a user can scan through the\r\nlist and have the phone speak back the directions. This functionality was implemented to give the user another option.\r\n\r\n(4) Finally, the user can take advantage of the compass and vibration feature on this screen as detailed in the next\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n### Compass and Vibration\r\n\r\nWhile the map screen provides additional features, the compass and vibration mode is the most prominent feature of our\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nTo activate the compass and vibration mode, the user double taps on the map screen. (This gesture is referred to as\r\nthe \"magic button\" because it turns this mode on and off.) Afterwards, the user can move the phone radially around\r\nher. The phone vibrates when the user is facing the correct direction. The user should double tap on the map screen\r\nagain to deactivate the mode and continue walking the direction determined by the phone.\r\n\r\nThe intended use of this compass and vibration mode is to check the user's heading at interest points (like\r\nintersections) along the route, or whenever the user simply needs to verify her heading. Therefore, the user should\r\nactivate the mode, check her heading, and then deactivate immediately. While one can activate the mode and leave it\r\nenabled throughout the entire route, it may not be accurate enough to direct the user along the route.\r\n\r\nFor effective feedback from the compass, the user should hold the phone parallel to the ground, move the phone\r\nradially (point the phone 360 degrees around the person), and move the phone slowly. Since the compass is not entirely\r\naccurate, we advise using this feature to \"check\" the heading occasionally along the route, not to depend on it\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n\r\nWe foresee a few extensions and modifications of the Phone Wand that would be valuable blind and low-vision accessible \r\napplications.\r\n\r\n### Indoor Navigation using RFID Tags\r\n\r\nWillis and Helal's paper \"RFID information grid for blind navigation and wayfinding\" lays out the foundations needed\r\nto use and construct an indoor RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based indoor navigation system. RFID tags are\r\ncheap, extremely power efficient devices with immense portability that can hold a small amount of information. They are\r\nextremely useful in pervasive computing by (literally) attaching computer data to physical objects. Indoor navigation\r\nis solved by rigging buildings with thousands of RFIDs each containing a small piece of geographical information. The\r\nadvantage of RFID readers vs. GPS is in the locality of the information that can be encoded in the RFID. The\r\nconstruction is based on \"mature technology\" so the limiting factors for widespread use of the infrastructure\r\ntechnology is simply economical feasibility and adoption. With demonstrated success in large corporations and college\r\ncampuses the technology could be come widespread and worked into building code standards.\r\n\r\nIn order for Android to take advantage and drive this potentially navigation changing technology, Android would either\r\nneed to implement an internal RFID reader or provide some simple cost-effective RFID reader attachment. The limiting\r\nfactor is hardware. The implications of a Blind indoor navigation tool would be extremely valuable for users to\r\nnavigate complicated indoor areas with little or no GPS capabilities such as airports, public transportation\r\nterminals, malls, and stadiums.\r\n\r\n### Indoor Navigation using RFID Tags\r\n\r\nA useful extension to the Phone Wand would be transferring orientation and vibration feedback to a walking cane via \r\nBluetooth. A cane is the most natural and useful tool to aid blind people in everyday walking. This extension would \r\nrequire embedding hardware for compass sensors and vibration directly into a walking cane. There already exists bulky \r\nand expensive electronic aided canes on the market that use sonar to detect solid obstacles and puddles within a \"zone \r\nof safety\". But user feedback indicates these tend to be too expensive or non-functional for practical use. With the \r\nhardware problem solved, a CaneNavigator Android application would allow users to simply enter all route information \r\ninto the cell phone, then the Bluetooth would activate, and then the cell phone could be placed in the users pocket. \r\nAll information sensing would then be embedded in the cane and then transferred to the cell phone via Bluetooth. \r\nInformation would then be processed and vibration signals would transfer from the phone to the cane via Bluetooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[main-url]: http://code.google.com/p/mobileaccessibility/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FPhoneWand"},{"id":"uw-graphics","titleShort":"OpenGL\nAnimations","titleLong":"OpenGL Models and Animations","urls":{},"jobTitle":"","date":"2/2011","categories":["school","uw","opengl","animation","c++"],"images":[{"fileName":"screenshot1.png","description":"A screenshot from the program showing a frog playing a ukulele.
