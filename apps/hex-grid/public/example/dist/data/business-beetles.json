  "content": "> Welcome to your first day as the CEO of Business Beetles! Lead your tiny beetle employee-servants by hiring recruiter beetles, raising revenue by selling your products, and employing guards who can defend you from the bird mafia (who may be out to collect on some unpaid loans the company might have failed to pay back). \r\n> \r\n> Try your best to keep the mini-corporation's profits high! (or at the very least, try your best to keep it profitable...hopefully...)\r\n\r\nSee the [devlog post](https:\/\/devlog.levi.dev\/2024\/10\/ludum-dare-56-business-beetles.html) for more info on the jam.\r\n\r\n## ‍💻 The jam\r\n\r\n**Theme: \"Tiny Creatures\"**\r\n\r\nWe made this game for the Ludum Dare 56 game jam.
