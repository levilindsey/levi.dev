  "content": "Levi was a teacher's assistant for Software Construction for two quarters and for Intro to Programming for two quarters.\r\n\r\nBoth of these courses were taught using C++.\r\n\r\n## Un-edited end-of-quarter reviews\r\n\r\n> He is the best TA i have ever seen.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Levi is always available and helpful to his students. He gives good feedback, which helps the overall learning process. He is kind and always motivates his students. Always in a good mood!\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Great TA!. Really nice and knows how to talk to people. Explains the problem and lets you solve it for yourself instead of doing it for you. Made my first CS experience easy.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> I don't know how you did it, but managing to run around for 3 hours straight answering all our questions was extremely commendable, and you kept a happy face about it all the time. I'd love to have you as a TA in the future! Thanks for everything\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Levi was a really great TA. He is very helpful and approachable as well. He was indeed to go-to person for me whenever I needed help. I understood everything that he said clearly.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Very helpful and easy to approach. He truly cares if the students in his lab and others are learning or not. One of my best TA's so far.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Levi has been a great instructor, and is a very approachable person that as a student I do not hesitate to ask him questions.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> You were so helpful and such a good teacher! And super sweet. Thank you!\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> BEST TA EVER :)"
