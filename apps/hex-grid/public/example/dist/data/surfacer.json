  "content": "_Point-and-click platformers!_\r\n\r\n_An AI and pathfinding 2D-platformer framework for [Godot](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/)._\r\n\r\n_\"Surfacer\": Like a platformer, but with walking, climbing, and jumping on all surfaces!_\r\n\r\n![Surfaces and edges in a plattform graph](https:\/\/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/levi-portfolio-media\/surfacer\/surfaces-and-edges.png)\r\n\r\n**tl;dr**: Surfacer works by **pre-parsing** a level into a **\"platform graph\"**. The **nodes** are represented by points along the different surfaces in the level (floors, walls, and ceilings). The **edges** are represented by possible movement trajectories between points along surfaces. There are different types of edges for different types of movement (e.g., jumping from a floor to a floor, falling from a wall, walking along a floor). At run time, **[A* search](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A*_search_algorithm)** is used to calculate a path to a given destination.\r\n\r\nSome features include:\r\n-   Surfacer includes a powerful **character-behavior system** for easily creating a character AI with high-level behaviors like \"wander\", \"follow\", \"run-away\", \"return\".\r\n-   Easy-to-use point-and-click navigation for player-controlled characters.\r\n-   [Configurable movement parameters](https:\/\/github.com\/SnoringCatGames\/surfacer\/blob\/master\/src\/platform_graph\/edge\/models\/movement_params.gd) on a per-character basis (e.g., horizontal acceleration, jump power, gravity, collision boundary shape and size, which types of edge movement are allowed).\r\n-   Level creation using Godot's standard pattern with a [TileMap in the 2D scene editor](https:\/\/docs.godotengine.org\/en\/3.2\/tutorials\/2d\/using_tilemaps.html).\r\n-   Preparsing the level into a platform graph, and using A* search for efficient path-finding at runtime.\r\n-   A powerful inspector for analyzing the platform graph, in order to debug and better understand how edges were calculated.\r\n-   Walking on floors, climbing on walls, climbing on ceilings, jumping and falling from anywhere.\r\n-   [Variable-height jump and fast-fall](https:\/\/kotaku.com\/the-mechanics-behind-satisfying-2d-jumping-1761940693).\r\n-   Adjusting movement trajectories to move around intermediate surfaces (such as jumping over a wall or around a floor).\r\n\r\nSee [more details in the library's README](https:\/\/github.com\/SnoringCatGames\/surfacer).\r\n\r\nYou can also read more about how Surfacer's AI and movement works in **[this series of devlog posts on devlog.levi.dev](https:\/\/devlog.levi.dev\/2021\/09\/building-platformer-ai-from-low-level.html)**.\r\n\r\n> _Surfacer is owned by [Snoring Cat LLC](https:\/\/snoringcat.games)._"
