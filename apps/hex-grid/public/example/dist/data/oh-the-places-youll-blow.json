  "content": "> 🍬🫧 The age-old story of blowing an overly ambitious bubble and being carried away to lands unknown.\r\n\r\n🎙️ This game is controlled using only your microphone!\r\n\r\n⏰ This was made in 48 hours for [Global Game Jam 2025](https:\/\/globalgamejam.org\/games\/2025\/oh-places-youll-blow-7).\r\n\r\n🐞 The Windows build has the fewest issues. On Android, we have sometimes seen issues with the audio input cutting out after half a minute or so.\r\n\r\n⭐ The theme for the jam was \"Bubble\".\r\n\r\n### 🙌 Our team\r\n\r\n-   **Alden Witt** — _Music & Sound Design_ — **[instagram.com\/aldenwitty](https:\/\/instagram.com\/aldenwitty)**\r\n-   **Levi Lindsey** — _Code & Art_ — **[levi.dev](https:\/\/levi.dev)**\r\n"
