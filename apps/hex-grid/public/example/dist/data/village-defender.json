Except of course for my frameworks (which is fine, you're allowed to use pre-existing code).\n\n### üí° The theme\n\n\"Every 10 seconds\"\n\n\n## üéÆ Controls\n\nüñ±Ô∏è+‚å®Ô∏è\n-   WASD\/arrows to move\n-   Space to jump\n-   Click on units to select and command them\n\n\n## üíø Software used\n\n-   **[Godot](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/):** Game engine.\n-   **[Aseprite](https:\/\/www.aseprite.org\/):** Pixel-art image editor.\n-   **[FamiStudio](https:\/\/famistudio.org\/):** Chiptune music tracker.\n-   **[Bfxr](https:\/\/www.bfxr.net\/):** Sound effects editor.\n-   **[Surfacer](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/asset-library\/asset\/968):** Framework for procedural path-finding across 2D platforms.\n-   **[Scaffolder](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/asset-library\/asset\/969):** Framework for general app and UI infrastructure.\n-   **[SurfaceTiler](https:\/\/github.com\/SnoringCatGames\/surface_tiler):** Framework for \"next-level\" autotiling.\n\n\n![A villager](https:\/\/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/levi-portfolio-media\/village-defender\/worker_standing_256.gif)\n"
