Except of course for my frameworks (which is fine, you're allowed to use pre-existing code).\r\n\r\n### üí° The theme\r\n\r\n\"Every 10 seconds\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## üéÆ Controls\r\n\r\nüñ±Ô∏è+‚å®Ô∏è\r\n-   WASD\/arrows to move\r\n-   Space to jump\r\n-   Click on units to select and command them\r\n\r\n\r\n## üíø Software used\r\n\r\n-   **[Godot](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/):** Game engine.\r\n-   **[Aseprite](https:\/\/www.aseprite.org\/):** Pixel-art image editor.\r\n-   **[FamiStudio](https:\/\/famistudio.org\/):** Chiptune music tracker.\r\n-   **[Bfxr](https:\/\/www.bfxr.net\/):** Sound effects editor.\r\n-   **[Surfacer](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/asset-library\/asset\/968):** Framework for procedural path-finding across 2D platforms.\r\n-   **[Scaffolder](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/asset-library\/asset\/969):** Framework for general app and UI infrastructure.\r\n-   **[SurfaceTiler](https:\/\/github.com\/SnoringCatGames\/surface_tiler):** Framework for \"next-level\" autotiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n![A villager](https:\/\/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/levi-portfolio-media\/village-defender\/worker_standing_256.gif)\r\n"
