  "content": "_A top-down, 2D game where you harness the incredible power of beans to stave off hoards of admirers who are inexplicably attracted to you._\r\n\r\n> Prepare yourself for epic music and foul farts. No win condition currently - see how far you can get!\r\n\r\nFeaturing:\r\n-   A ridiculously **over-the-top soundtrack**.\r\n-   Classy **AI-powered voiceovers**.\r\n-   Only a very tasteful sprinkling of **gratuitous fart humor**.\r\n\r\n## The jam\r\n\r\nThis game was created in 48-hours as a [submission](https:\/\/globalgamejam.org\/games\/2024\/pull-my-finger-bean-based-survival-game-6) for the [2024 Global Game Jam](https:\/\/globalgamejam.org\/).\r\n\r\n**Theme: \"Make me laugh\"**\r\n\r\nIt's completely the theme's fault that we were obligated to rely on so much fart humor. Our hands were tied...\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThis time around, I worked with just [Alden Witt](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/aldenwitty)!\r\n\r\n-   [Unreal Engine 5](https:\/\/www.unrealengine.com\/en-US\/).\r\n-   [Pro Tools](https:\/\/www.avid.com\/pro-tools) for sound and music creation.\r\n-   [PaperZD](https:\/\/www.unrealengine.com\/marketplace\/en-US\/product\/paperzd) plugin for 2D character animations.\r\n-   [SpriteMancer](https:\/\/codemanu.itch.io\/spritemancer) for particle effects.\r\n-   [freesound.org](https:\/\/freesound.org\/) for some SFX  (others were original).\r\n-   [Modern Interiors](https:\/\/limezu.itch.io\/moderninteriors) asset pack by LimeZu for the tilesets.\r\n-   [ElevenLabs](https:\/\/elevenlabs.io\/) for AI voice generation of the narration.\r\n\r\nüßë‚Äçüé§üé∏ Special thanks to [Candi Carpenter](https:\/\/www.candicarpenter.com\/) for cowriting\/vocals and [Aaron Kessler](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/aaronkesslermusic\/?hl=en) for the blazing guitar solo!\r\n"
