A non-jarring look is especially important for new-tab content, since this is shown every time you open a new tab!\r\n\r\nIf you'd instead prefer to customize the colors, Dark Time let's you do that! Just open up extension settings in the usual way through Chrome's UI.\r\n\r\n> _Dark Time is owned by [Snoring Cat LLC](https:\/\/snoringcat.games)._"
