  "content": "_Oh no! The player is stuck inside a \"loop\"--that is, their inner tube--from a tragic inner-tubing accident that left them stuck in the bottom of an endless crevasse!_\r\n\r\nThis is an endless climber game, with fun wall bouncing!\r\n\r\n## Ludum Dare 47\r\n\r\n_**[Ludum Dare 47 Submission](https:\/\/ldjam.com\/events\/ludum-dare\/47\/stuck-in-an-inner-tube\/)**_\r\n\r\nThis game is based off of a \"Compo\" submission for the [Ludum Dare 47 game jam](https:\/\/ldjam.com\/events\/ludum-dare\/47\/stuck-in-an-inner-tube\/). All design, code, images, sound effects, and music were created by Levi in under 48 hours. This game rated in the 90th percentile for \"Overall\", \"Fun\", \"Graphics\", \"Audio\", and \"Humor\" (and in the 95th percentile for \"Fun\"!). The creation of this game was also [livestreamed on Twitch](https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/ukulelefury\/videos).\r\n\r\n### The theme: \"Stuck in a loop\"\r\n\r\nThe theme for the game jam was \"stuck in a loop\". This game addresses the theme in two ways:\r\n1.  The player is stuck inside a \"loop\"--that is, their inner tube--from a tragic inner-tubing accident.\r\n2.  The vertically-scrolling level has no end, it \"loops\" through previous platforms if you get far enough.\r\n\r\n## Software used\r\n\r\n-   [Godot](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/) was used to create this game.\r\n-   [Aseprite](https:\/\/www.aseprite.org\/) was used to create the images.\r\n-   [Bfxr](https:\/\/www.bfxr.net\/) was used to create the sound effects.\r\n-   [DefleMask](https:\/\/deflemask.com\/) was used to create the music.\r\n-   [Trello](https:\/\/trello.com\/b\/GvuTgtRC\/ludum-dare-47) was used for brainstorming and planning.\r\n\r\n## Licenses\r\n\r\n-   The code is published under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\r\n-   The art assets (files under `assets\/images\/`, `assets\/music\/`, and `assets\/sfx\/`) are published under the [CC0 1.0 Universal license](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/deed.en).\r\n-   This project depends on various pieces of third-party code that are licensed separately.
