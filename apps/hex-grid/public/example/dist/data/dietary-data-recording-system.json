  "content": "During his undergraduate studies at the University of Washington, Levi spent more than a year working with [Professor Alexander Mamishev][mamishev-url] in the [Sensors Energy and Automation Laboratory][seal-url]. The lab had been hired by the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center][fred-hutch-url] to create a Dietary Data Recording device that would better record the dietary intake of their study participants.\r\n\r\nThe lab's work revolved around the development of an application that ran on Android devices. Levi was the sole developer for this.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nSome of the application's functionalities included:\r\n\r\n- Recording accelerometer and magnetometer data and associating them with individual video frames in order to analyze\r\nthe volume of food\r\n- Firing a laser grid via an external, custom-made, Bluetooth-compatible device\r\n- Recording and playing audio and video\r\n- Scanning barcodes\r\n- Compressing, uploading, and downloading data from the databases on our server\r\n- Recording dietary info in an SQLite database\r\n- Parsing SQL data to and from an XML file\r\n\r\n## Paper\r\n\r\nLevi co-authored a paper on this research entitled [A Pervasive Dietary Data Recording System][paper-url].\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\n> The purpose of this research is to determine how beneficial the use of real-time, computer-mediated dietary data recording can be in medical studies. Current methods of dietary tracking and assessment typically involve paper and  pencil food diaries and\/or periodic dietary interviews, and these tend to be imprecise, yielding inconclusive results  as to how a study participant’s diet affects his or her health. Reasons for this imprecision include participant bias, errors in the participant’s memory, errors in the participant’s judgment of food quantities, and underreporting from the participant. The use of computer technology should be able to remedy many of these problems. This project focuses on creating a device based on mobile phones and hand-held computers to record a participant’s dietary intake. This Dietary Data Recording System (DDRS) will serve as a convenient method for real-time documentation of a participant’s intake, and will allow the participant to record both an audio and a visual description of their food. A fundamental aspect of DDRS is the use of a laser-generated grid of distances in coordination with stereo-optic images for the determination of food volume. This device should provide confirmation as to whether real-time computer-assisted recording of dietary data is manageable and accurate.\r\n\r\n[mamishev-url]: http:\/\/ee.washington.edu\/faculty\/mamishev\/\r\n[seal-url]: http:\/\/ee.washington.edu\/research\/seal\/\r\n[fred-hutch-url]: http:\/\/fredhutch.org\/en.html\r\n[paper-url]: http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5766890&isnumber=5766834&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D5766890%26isnumber%3D5766834"
