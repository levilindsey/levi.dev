The **nodes** are represented by points along the different surfaces in the level (floors, walls, and ceilings). The **edges** are represented by possible movement trajectories between points along surfaces. There are different types of edges for different types of movement (e.g., jumping from a floor to a floor, falling from a wall, walking along a floor). At run time, **[A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)** is used to calculate a path to a given destination.\r\n\r\nSome features include:\r\n-   Surfacer includes a powerful **character-behavior system** for easily creating a character AI with high-level behaviors like \"wander\", \"follow\", \"run-away\", \"return\".\r\n-   Easy-to-use point-and-click navigation for player-controlled characters.\r\n-   [Configurable movement parameters](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/surfacer/blob/master/src/platform_graph/edge/models/movement_params.gd) on a per-character basis (e.g., horizontal acceleration, jump power, gravity, collision boundary shape and size, which types of edge movement are allowed).\r\n-   Level creation using Godot's standard pattern with a [TileMap in the 2D scene editor](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/tutorials/2d/using_tilemaps.html).\r\n-   Preparsing the level into a platform graph, and using A* search for efficient path-finding at runtime.\r\n-   A powerful inspector for analyzing the platform graph, in order to debug and better understand how edges were calculated.\r\n-   Walking on floors, climbing on walls, climbing on ceilings, jumping and falling from anywhere.\r\n-   [Variable-height jump and fast-fall](https://kotaku.com/the-mechanics-behind-satisfying-2d-jumping-1761940693).\r\n-   Adjusting movement trajectories to move around intermediate surfaces (such as jumping over a wall or around a floor).\r\n\r\nSee [more details in the library's README](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/surfacer).\r\n\r\nYou can also read more about how Surfacer's AI and movement works in **[this series of devlog posts on devlog.levi.dev](https://devlog.levi.dev/2021/09/building-platformer-ai-from-low-level.html)**.\r\n\r\n> _Surfacer is owned by [Snoring Cat LLC](https://snoringcat.games)._"},{"id":"scaffolder","titleShort":"Godot\napplication\nscaffolding","titleLong":"Scaffolder: Application scaffolding and utility functionality for Godot","emphasis":1,"color":"#4488c0","urls":{"github":"https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder","godot-asset-library":"https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/969"},"jobTitle":"","location":"","date":{"start":"11/2020","end":"Present","tieBreaker":12},"categories":["Side-Project","App","Godot","Game","2D","Library"],"images":[{"fileName":"scaffolder-gui.gif","description":"Scaffolder provides a bunch of general-purpose UI and application scaffolding, such as a widget library and a a screen layout and navigation system."},{"fileName":"scaffolder-resizing.gif","description":"Scaffolder provides a sophisticated rescaling system to help you make responsive UIs."}],"videos":[],"content":"This is an opinionated framework that provides a bunch of general-purpose application scaffolding and utility functionality for Godot games.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Viewport scaling\r\n\r\nThis framework handles viewport scaling directly. You will need to turn off Godot's built-in viewport scaling (`Display > Window > Stretch > Mode = disabled`).\r\n\r\nThis provides some powerful benefits over Godot's standard behaviors, but requires you to be careful with how you define your GUI layouts.\r\n\r\n#### Handling camera zoom\r\n\r\nThis provides limited flexibility in how far the camera is zoomed. That is, you will be able to see more of the level on a larger screen, but not too much more of the level. Similarly, on a wider screen, you will be able to able to see more from side to side, but not too much more.\r\n\r\n-   You can configure a minimum and maximum aspect ratio for the game region.\r\n-   You can configure a default screen size and aspect ratio that the levels are designed around.\r\n-   At runtime, if the current viewport aspect ratio is greater than the max or less than the min, bars will be shown along the sides or top and bottom of the game area.\r\n-   At runtime, the camera zoom will be adjusted so that the same amount of level is showing, either vertically or horizontally, as would be visible with the configured default screen size. If the screen aspect ratio is different than the default, then a little more of the level is visible in the other direction.\r\n-   Any annotations that are drawn in the separate annotations CanvasLayer are automatically transformed to match whatever the game-area's current zoom and position is.\r\n-   Click positions can also be transformed to match the game area.\r\n\r\n#### Handling GUI scale\r\n\r\n-   At runtime, a `gui_scale` value is calculated according to how the current screen resolution compares to the expected default screen resolution, as described above.\r\n-   Then all fonts—which are registered with the scaffold configuration—are resized according to this `gui_scale`.\r\n-   Then the size, position, and scale of all GUI nodes are updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Constraints for how you define your GUI layouts\r\n\r\n> TODO: List any other constraints/tips.\r\n\r\n-   Avoid custom positions, except maybe for centering images. For example:\r\n    -   Instead of encoding a margin/offset, use a VBoxContainer or HBoxContainer parent, and include an empty spacer sibling with size or min-size.\r\n    -   This is especially important when your positioning is calculated to include bottom/right-side margins.\r\n-   Centering images:\r\n    -   To center an image, I often place a `TextureRect` inside of a `Control` inside of some time of auto-positioning container.\r\n    -   I then set the image position in this way: `TextureRect.rect_position = -TextureRect.rect_size/2`.\r\n    -   This wrapper pattern also works well when I need to scale the image.\r\n-   In general, whenever possible, I find it helpful to use a VBoxContainer or HBoxContainer as a parent, and to have children use the shrink-center size flag for both horizontal and vertical directions along with a min-size.\r\n\r\n### Analytics\r\n\r\nThis feature depends on the proprietary third-party **[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/)** service.\r\n\r\n-   Fortunately, Google Analytics is at least free to use.\r\n-   To get started with Google Analytics, [read this doc](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en).\r\n-   To learn more about the \"Measurement Protocol\" API that this class uses to send event info, [read this doc](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1).\r\n-   To learn more about the \"Reporting API\" you could use to run arbitrary queries on your recorded analytics, [read this doc](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4).\r\n    -   Alternatively, you could just use [Google's convenient web client](http://analytics.google.com/).\r\n\r\n#### \"Privacy Policy\" and \"Terms and Conditions\" documents\r\n\r\nIf you intend to record any sort of user data (including app-usage analytics or crash logs), you should create a \"Privacy Policy\" document and a \"Terms and Conditions\" document. These are often legally required when recording any sort of app-usage data. Fortunately, there are a lot of tools out there to help you easily generate these documents. You could then easily host these as view-only [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/).\r\n\r\nHere are two such generator tools that might be useful, and at least have free-trial options:\r\n-   [Termly's privacy policy generator](https://termly.io/products/privacy-policy-generator/?ftseo)\r\n-   [Nishant's terms and conditions generator](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.nisrulz.com/)\r\n\r\n> _**DISCLAIMER:** I'm not a lawyer, so don't interpret anything from this framework as legal advice, and make sure you understand which laws you need to obey._\r\n\r\n### Automatic error/crash reporting\r\n\r\nThis feature currently depends on the proprietary third-party **[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)** service. But you could easily override it to upload logs somewhere else.\r\n\r\n### Screen layout and navigation\r\n\r\n-   You can control transitions through `Gs.nav`.\r\n-   It is easy to include custom screens and exclude default screens.\r\n-   Here are some of the default screns included:\r\n    -   Main menu\r\n    -   Credits\r\n    -   Settings\r\n        -   Configurable to display checkboxes, dropdowns, or plain text for whatever settings you might want to support.\r\n    -   Level select\r\n    -   Game/level\r\n    -   Pause\r\n    -   Notification\r\n        -   Configurable to display custom text and buttons as needed.\r\n    -   Game over\r\n\r\n### Lots of useful utility functions\r\n\r\nIt might just be easiest to scroll through some of the following files to see what sorts of functions are included:\r\n-   [`Audio`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/utils/Audio.gd)\r\n-   [`CameraShake`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/utils/CameraShake.gd)\r\n-   [`DrawUtils`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/utils/DrawUtils.gd)\r\n-   [`Geometry`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/utils/Geometry.gd)\r\n-   [`Profiler`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/utils/Profiler.gd)\r\n-   [`SaveState`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/data/SaveState.gd)\r\n-   [`Time`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/utils/Time.gd)\r\n-   [`Utils`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/utils/Utils.gd)\r\n\r\n### A widget library\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n-   [`AccordionPanel`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/gui/AccordionPanel.gd)\r\n-   [`LabeledControlList`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/gui/labeled_control_list/LabeledControlList.gd)\r\n-   [`ShinyButton`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/gui/ShinyButton.gd)\r\n-   [`NavBar`](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/scaffolder/blob/master/src/gui/NavBar.gd)\r\n\r\n> _Scaffolder is owned by [Snoring Cat LLC](https://snoringcat.games)._\r\n"},{"id":"snoring-cat","titleShort":"Snoring Cat LLC","titleLong":"Snoring Cat LLC","emphasis":0.6,"color":"#7e664d","urls":{"snoring-cat":"https://snoringcat.games"},"jobTitle":"Owner and manager","location":"Seattle, WA","date":{"start":"2/2021","end":"Present","tieBreaker":9},"categories":["Work","Art","Animation","Music","Godot","Game","2D","Solo-Work"],"images":[{"fileName":"icon-512.png","description":"A pixel-art sleeping cat."}],"videos":[],"content":"Levi formed Snoring Cat LLC to publish some of his more substantial games and software projects under.\r\n\r\nCheck out Snoring Cat LLC's site at [snoringcat.games](https://snoringcat.games).\r\n\r\nIf you're curious about what-all went into forming this LLC, check out [this devlog post](https://devlog.levi.dev/2021/02/snoring-cat-forming-llc.html).\r\n"},{"id":"Music","titleShort":"Music:\nPerformances &\ncompositions","titleLong":"Music composition and performance","emphasis":0.6,"color":"#f774ff","urls":{"youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIuJN99AFOPRwoYLk6O_j8kPK6UtWQTIk","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/levilindsey"},"jobTitle":"Singer, arranger, composer","location":"","date":{"start":"4/27/1988","end":"Present","tieBreaker":3},"categories":["Music"],"images":[],"videos":[],"content":"Levi has an extensive musical background.\r\n\r\n* He has been a singer all his life, and he's played [various instruments](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIuJN99AFOPTzVmY-g6RAwP9CAIIa-PtS) along the way.\r\n* He has a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance from the University of Washington.\r\n* He's sung in many operas and musicals, including **Dido and Aeneas** (Aeneas), **Savitri** (Satyavan), and **My Fair Lady** (Henry Higgins).\r\n* He's sung in dozens of [choirs and a capella groups](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIuJN99AFOPRl5MH9GwFQWpPEP3zkPLBs).\r\n* In recent years, he's also been [composing music](https://soundcloud.com/levilindsey/sets/chiptunes) (mostly chiptunes for his game projects).\r\n\r\nYou can listen to many of Levi's [compositions](https://soundcloud.com/levilindsey/sets/chiptunes) and [performances](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIuJN99AFOPSF3p4f0siFo22XiMXqijQU) on YouTube and SoundCloud.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<iframe\r\n    width=\"100%\"\r\n    height=\"450\"\r\n    scrolling=\"no\"\r\n    frameborder=\"no\"\r\n    allow=\"autoplay\"\r\n    src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1362818677&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\">\r\n</iframe>\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 10px;

Includes a 3D WebGL-based [graphics framework][grafx], a [physics engine][physx] with 3D rigid-body dynamics and collision detection (with impulse-based resolution), and miscellaneous other features that are commonly needed when creating a game._\r\n\r\n## Grafx: A 3D graphics framework for WebGL\r\n\r\n### Notable features\r\n\r\n- A system for defining 3D shapes, models, and controllers.\r\n- A system for configuring and drawing multiple simultaneous [WebGL programs][webgl-program].\r\n- A system for loading and compiling WebGL shaders and programs.\r\n- Support for both per-model and post-processing shaders. \r\n- A system for loading textures.\r\n- An animation framework.\r\n- A camera framework with built-in first-person and third-person cameras.\r\n- A collection of basic shape definitions, each with vertex position, normal, texture coordinate, and vertex indices configurations.\r\n- Algorithms for converting to and from a vertex-indexing array.\r\n- An algorithm for polygon [tesselation][tesselation].\r\n  - This is used for subdividing all faces of a polygon into a parameterized number of triangles.\r\n  - All of the resulting vertices can then be pushed out to a given radius in order to render a smoother sphere.\r\n- An algorithm for mapping spherical lat-long textures onto an icosahedron.\r\n  - This involves careful consideration of the texture coordinates around the un-even seam of the icosahedron.\r\n\r\n## Physx: A physics engine with 3D rigid-body dynamics and collision detection (with impulse-based resolution).\r\n\r\n### Notable features\r\n\r\n- Includes continuous [collision detection][collision-detection] with [impulse-based resolution][collision-resolution].\r\n- [Decouples the physics simulation and animation rendering time steps][stable-time-steps], and uses a fixed timestep for the physics loop. This provides numerical stability and precise reproducibility.\r\n- Suppresses linear and angular momenta below a certain threshold.\r\n\r\nThe engine consists primarily of a collection of individual physics jobs and an update loop. This update loop is in turn controlled by the animation loop. However, whereas the animation loop renders each job once per frame loop&mdash;regardless of how much time actually elapsed since the previous frame&mdash;the physics loop updates its jobs at a constant rate. To reconcile these frame rates, the physics loop runs as many times as is needed in order to catch up to the time of the current animation frame. The physics frame rate should be much higher than the animation frame rate.\r\n\r\n### Collision Detection\r\n\r\nThis physics engine also includes a collision-detection pipeline. This will detect collisions between collidable bodies and update their momenta in response to the collisions.\r\n\r\n- Consists of an efficient broad-phase collision detection step followed by a precise narrow-phase step.\r\n- Calculates the position, surface normal, and time of each contact.\r\n- Calculates the impulse of a collision and updates the bodies' linear and angular momenta in response.\r\n- Applies Coulomb friction to colliding bodies.\r\n- Sub-divides the time step to more precisely determine when and where a collision occurs.\r\n- Supports multiple collisions with a single body in a single time step.\r\n- Efficiently supports bodies coming to rest against each other.\r\n- Bodies will never penetrate one another.\r\n- This does not address the [tunnelling problem][tunnelling-problem]. That is, it is possible for two fast-moving bodies to pass through each other as long as they did not intersect each other during any time step.\r\n- This only supports collisions between certain types of shapes. Fortunately, this set provides reasonable approximations for most other shapes. The supported types of shapes are:\r\n    - [sphere][sphere]\r\n    - [capsule][capsule]\r\n    - [AABB][aabb]\r\n    - [OBB][obb]\r\n\r\n\r\n[grafx]: https://github.com/levilindsey/grafx\r\n[physx]: https://github.com/levilindsey/physx\r\n\r\n[webgl-program]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLProgram\r\n[tesselation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation\r\n\r\n[collision-detection]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection\r\n[collision-resolution]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_response#Impulse-based_contact_model\r\n[stable-time-steps]: https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/\r\n[tunnelling-problem]: https://www.aorensoftware.com/blog/2011/06/01/when-bullets-move-too-fast/\r\n[sphere]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere\r\n[capsule]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(geometry)\r\n[aabb]: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Axis-aligned_bounding_box&redirect=no\r\n[obb]: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oriented_bounding_box&redirect=no\r\n"},{"id":"google-greentea","titleShort":"Google:\nGreentea","titleLong":"Google: Greentea","emphasis":1,"color":"#0d904f","urls":{"homepage":"https://google.com/about"},"jobTitle":"Software Engineer","location":"Mountain View, CA","date":{"start":"4/2015","end":"12/2016"},"categories":["Work","Web","Frontend","Angular","Dart","Teamwork"],"images":[{"fileName":"greentea-public-flutter-demo-screenshot.png","description":"This is a public demo screenshot of the Flutter (mobile) version of the Greentea app."}],"videos":[],"content":"_[Google][google-url] is a multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products.

So he made hex-grid.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nSome features of this package include:\r\n\r\n- A particle system complete with neighbor and anchor position spring forces.\r\n- An assortment of **persistent** animations that make the grid _exciting to watch_.\r\n- An assortment of **transient** animations that make the grid _exciting to interact with_.\r\n- A control panel that enables you to adjust most of the many different parameters of this system.\r\n- The ability to display custom collections of posts.\r\n    - These posts will be displayed within individual tiles.\r\n    - These tile posts can be expanded for more information.\r\n    - The contents of these posts use standard [Markdown syntax][markdown-url], which is then parsed by the system for displaying within the grid.\r\n\r\n## The Tile-Expansion Algorithm\r\n\r\nThe following diagrams help to visualize how the grid is expanded.\r\n\r\n### A Basic Sector Expansion\r\n\r\nThis image illustrates how the grid is expanded in order to show an enlarged area with details for a given tile.

For each of these relationships, both the vertical and horizontal grid configurations are illustrated.\r\n\r\nEach tile holds a reference to each of its neighbor tiles. These references are stored in an array that is indexed according to the position of the neighbor tiles relative to the given tile. The left-most images show which positions correspond to which indices.\r\n\r\nThe expanded grid holds an array with references to each of the six sectors.

This helps to keep your code modular, scalable, and  easier to understand.\r\n- **Gulp tasks**: This includes a wide array of gulp tasks for optimizing frontend performance and streamlining your  development process.\r\n- **App infrastructure**: This creates a comprehensive boilerplate infrastructure for a end-to-end web application  using the MEAN stack. This likely includes some extra bells and whistles that you may not want to include in your  particular app. The goal of this project is to promote development through _subtractive_ synthesis. What this means  is that, hopefully, this generator creates infrastructure that will handle most of the high-level problems in your  web app, in addition to providing some other common features that you will likely remove.\r\n- **Tests**: This includes a testing infrastructure using the [Karma][karma-url] test runner and the  [Jasmine][jasmine-url] test framework for testing the frontend code.\r\n- **SASS**: This uses the [SASS][sass-url] stylesheet language.\r\n- **UI-Router**: This uses the [UI-Router][ui-router-url] library for more powerful frontend routing and state  management in Angular.\r\n\r\n## Why use this generator instead of one of the many other options?\r\n\r\nMaybe you shouldn't! Check out the file structure, the gulp tasks, and the various libraries and tools that are used   in this project. If these are all aspects that you agree with, then please try this generator out! Otherwise, there  are many other great generators out there for you to use. Addy Osmani has an [excellent article][addy-osmani-url]  describing MEAN-stack development and a quick survey of some of the more popular generators and boilerplate options  for it. Each of these options have different benefits and each option uses a different set of tools.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g generator-meanie\r\nyo meanie\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the [getting set up guide][getting-set-up-url] for a step-by-step walkthrough for setting things up and\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n## Technology stack / acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis project uses technology from a number of third-parties. These technologies include:\r\n\r\n- [Node.js][node-url]\r\n- [AngularJS][angular-url]\r\n- [MongoDB][mongo-url]\r\n- [gulp.js][gulp-url]\r\n- [SASS][sass-url]\r\n- [Yeoman][yeoman-url]\r\n- [Git][git-url]\r\n- Numerous other packages that are available via [NPM][npm-url] (these are listed within the [`package.json`][package.json-url] file)\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis project is an on-going effort to collect common patterns and processes for developing web apps using the MEAN  stack and gulp. It is constantly evolving and gaining new features.\r\n\r\nThe contents of this project is strongly opinionated. This is all code that was originally developed and tested by  Levi for his own personal use.

With this package, each character animates individually, and it is simple to customize this animation.\r\n\r\nThis package is available in the Bower registry as [`text-animation`][bower-url].\r\n\r\n### The In-Order Animation Algorithm\r\n\r\n1. Iterate through each descendant node in the root element's DOM structure  \r\n  a. This uses a pre-order tree traversal\r\n  b. Store the text of each text node along with the parent element and next sibling node associated with the text node\r\n  c. Fix each descendant element with its original dimensions\r\n  d. Empty out all text nodes\r\n2. Iterate through each character and animate them  \r\n  a. This is now a simple linear iteration, because we flattened the DOM structure in our earlier traversal  \r\n  b. Animate the character  \r\n    1. Add the character to a span  \r\n    2. Insert the span into the character's parent element  \r\n      a. If the original text node has a next sibling node, then insert this span before that node  \r\n      b. Otherwise, append this node to the end of the original text node's parent node  \r\n    4. Run the actual animation of the isolated character  \r\n  c. Finish animating the character  \r\n    1. Remove the span  \r\n    2. Concatenate the character back into the original text node  \r\n\r\nThe following three representations of the same DOM structure may help to understand  how this algorithm flattens and stores the DOM representation.\r\n\r\n#### Original HTML Representation\r\n\r\n    <body>\r\n      H\r\n      <p>\r\n        e\r\n      </p>\r\n      y\r\n      <div>\r\n        D\r\n        <p>\r\n          O\r\n        </p>\r\n        M\r\n      </div>\r\n      !\r\n    </body>\r\n\r\n#### Visual Tree Representation\r\n\r\n                                   <body>:Element\r\n          ________________________________|________________________________\r\n         /                /               |               \\                \\\r\n    H:TextNode      <p>:Element      y:TextNode      <div>:Element      !:TextNode\r\n                         |                  _______________|_______________\r\n                     e:TextNode            /               |               \\\r\n                                      D:TextNode      <p>:Element      M:TextNode\r\n                                                           |\r\n                                                       O:TextNode\r\n\r\n#### JavaScript Object Structure of Text Nodes\r\n\r\n    [\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <body>, \"nextSiblingNode\": <p>,   \"text\": \"H\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <p>,    \"nextSiblingNode\": null,  \"text\": \"e\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <body>, \"nextSiblingNode\": <div>, \"text\": \"y\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <div>,  \"nextSiblingNode\": <p>,   \"text\": \"D\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <p>,    \"nextSiblingNode\": null,  \"text\": \"O\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <div>,  \"nextSiblingNode\": null,  \"text\": \"M\"},\r\n      {\"parentElement\": <body>, \"nextSiblingNode\": null,  \"text\": \"!\"}\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\n[main-url]: https://levi.dev/text-animation\r\n[codepen-url]: http://codepen.io/levisl176/full/HGJdF\r\n[bower-url]: http://bower.io/search/?q=text-animation"},{"id":"anvato","titleShort":"Anvato","titleLong":"Anvato","emphasis":0.7,"color":"#d1242c","urls":{"homepage":"http://anvato.com"},"jobTitle":"Software Engineer","location":"Mountain View, CA","date":{"start":"10/2013","end":"3/2014"},"categories":["Work","Web","Frontend","Android","Java","Roku","Windows-Phone","C-Sharp","Video","Teamwork"],"images":[{"fileName":"screenshot1.png","description":"The Anvato web video player."},{"fileName":"screenshot4.png","description":"The Anvato web video player with the preview ribbon open while the user scrubs along the seek bar."},{"fileName":"screenshot5.png","description":"The Anvato web video player with the preview popup open while the user hovers over the seek bar."},{"fileName":"screenshot3.png","description":"The Anvato web video player with the volume control expanded."},{"fileName":"screenshot2.png","description":"The splash screen for the Anvato web video player."}],"videos":[],"content":"_[Anvato][main-url] provides live and on-demand video management, analytics, syndication, and tracking features along with video player SDKs for iOS, Android, and web._\r\n\r\nLevi developed HTTP Live Streaming video-player SDKs for the HTML5, Windows Store, Windows Phone, Roku, and Android platforms to match detailed specifications from clients including Fox, NBC, and Univision.\r\n\r\nThe HTML5 player SDK loaded and played four-times faster than that of Anvato’s leading competitor.\r\n\r\nThe combined Anvato player SDKs drew more than 528,000 viewers per minute during the 2014 SuperBowl, making it the most-viewed single sports event ever delivered online.\r\n\r\nAnvato was acquired by Google in 2016.\r\n\r\n[main-url]: http://anvato.com"},{"id":"fat-cat-chat","titleShort":"IRC-like\nchat","titleLong":"Fat Cat Chat","emphasis":0.6,"color":"#eeb6b6","urls":{"demo":"https://levi.dev/fat-cat-chat","github":"https://github.com/levilindsey/fat-cat-chat"},"jobTitle":"","location":"","date":"2/2014","categories":["Side-Project","Web","App","Art","Web-Sockets","socket.io","node.js","Express","Back-End","Frontend","Solo-Work"],"images":[{"fileName":"screenshot5.png","description":"All of the users currently in a chat room are shown in the right-side panel.

These angles are based off zero degrees along the horizontal axis. The angle value for a point is calculated as the average of the angles of the line segments connecting that point to its previous and next neighbors. These angles are then convoluted with a Gaussian smoothing kernel.\r\n\r\nNext, the given shape instance is uniformly scaled and translated so that its x and y coordinate values range from 0 to 1. It is also translated so that it is centered in this hypothetical, square, 1x1 canvas.\r\n\r\nDirectional pixel values are then computed for the given shape instance. There are four directional components associated with each pixel&mdash;the lines along 0&deg;, 45&deg;, 90&deg;, and 135&deg;. The value of a point for each of these four directions is 1 if the angle is different by 0&deg;, 0 if the angle is different by 45&deg; degrees or more, and linearly interpolated between 0 and 1 for angles differing by 0&deg;-45&deg;. Note that these directions also match with their opposites; i.e., if a point has an angle of 215&deg;, then it has a difference of 0&deg; with the 45&deg; line, and its value for its 45&deg; directional pixel is 1.\r\n\r\nThe entire bitmap region is not stored for each shape instance; in order to save space and time, a mapping from pixel indices to directional intensity values is created, and this mapping contains a key for a given pixel if and only if the shape instance contains a point in that pixel. There are actually four such mappings for each shape instance&mdash; one for each of the four directions. These mappings are created by looping over each of the points, determining in which pixel a point lies, and storing the four directional values of this point at this pixel index within the four mappings. If multiple points in a shape instance have values for the same direction in the same pixel, then the largest value is saved.\r\n\r\nThe discretization of ink means that we have two special cases to consider: when a single pixel contains multiple consecutive points, and when the line segment between two consecutive points intersects a pixel in which neither point actually lies. The former case is actually handled well with the aforementioned policy of saving a pixel's maximal intensity value for each direction. An alternative approach for this could have been to use the average angle values for consecutive points lying within the same pixel, but this causes a good deal of information to be lost within pixels containing high curvature&mdash;i.e., corners. The latter case could be handled robustly by calculating the intermediate pixels via the Bresenham line algorithm, but the lost pixels become less significant with more training examples. Also, a 3x3 Gaussian smoothing kernel is used to smooth the final values of the templates. However, these two points do not address the lost pixels from an unknown shape instance being recognized, and further research could be performed to determine whether the application of the Bresenham line algorithm would increase recognition accuracy.\r\n\r\n#### Training\r\n\r\nAfter each shape instance has been preprocessed, actually creating the templates is a simple process. For each shape class, four complete bitmaps are created&mdash;one for each direction&mdash;and then all of the pixel intensity values for each of the training shape instances are added together into the appropriate bitmaps. Each pixel in each bitmap is then normalized by the number of training instances for the given shape class template. Finally, a 3x3 Gaussian smoothing kernel is used to smooth the final values of each of the directional bitmaps for each template.\r\n\r\n#### Recognition\r\n\r\nTo recognize a given unknown shape instance, a simple distance metric is used, and the shape is classified as whichever class yields the smallest distance. This distance between a shape instance and a class template is computed  as\r\n\r\n![Shape-class distance equation][shape-class-distance-equation-image]\r\n\r\nwhere _I_ is the list of the pixel indices&mdash;i.e., keys&mdash;in the pixel indices to directional intensity values mappings, _s<sub>&theta;i</sub>_ is the directional intensity value from the &theta; directional mapping of the pixel at index _i_ for the unknown shape instance, _t<sub>&theta;i</sub>_ is the directional intensity value from the &theta; directional bitmap of the pixel at index _i_ for the shape class template, _n<sub>s</sub>_ is the number of pixels containing ink for the unknown shape instance, _n<sub>t</sub>_ is the average number of pixels containing ink for the shape class template, and _w_ is a weight parameter.\r\n\r\nThe term relating to the number of pixels containing ink is important, because this distance metric only considers pixels which are covered by the unknown shape instance. To understand why this is a problem, consider the example of the unknown shape instance being the letter P, and there are templates both for the letter P and the letter R. Because the distance only considers the pixels from the shape instance P, the P and R templates will be found to have roughly the same distance. This term for the number of pixels containing ink allows the distance metric to match the P shape instance more closely to the P template than the R template.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that rather than using this term for the number of pixels containing ink, that the distance metric could  simply sum over all of the pixels in the template bitmap rather than only over the pixels covered by the shape  instance, but this leads to its own problem. This would mean that whichever class template contains the least ink&mdash;in our case '-'&mdash;would nearly always be found to have the lowest distance.\r\n\r\n#### Parameters\r\n\r\n_w_ = 0.09\r\ntemplate side length (they are square) = 14\r\nnumber of smoothing iterations for the templates = 3\r\nnumber of smoothing iterations for the point angle values = 1\r\n\r\nThese values have been selected by hand.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nIn order to test this algorithm, a shape collection was compiled from 18 people each drawing 15 shapes 5 times with a few instances being lost due to collection error.\r\n\r\nThen an 18-fold cross-validation was performed with single-user hold outs. The averages from this test are presented in this confusion matrix.\r\n\r\n![Average results][average-results-image]\r\n\r\n_***NOTE: this screen shot should instead say \"18-fold\"**_\r\n\r\n### Strengths\r\n\r\nThe largest strength of this recognition algorithm is that it is extremely fast both to train and to recognize. It took, on average, 0.36 to perform the 18-fold cross-validation, 0.02 seconds to train, and 0.00006 seconds to recognize a shape instance.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm is scale invariant.\r\n\r\n### Weaknesses\r\n\r\nThis algorithm is rotationally variant, so it would not perform well with a system in which rotation mattered.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm does not fully take into account the conditional probabilities of the ink. The templates naturally represent a form of Gaussian probability for ink around a segment of the shape class&mdash;i.e., there is a higher  probability of the ink in an instance of the shape class lying in the center of the segment of the template than off  to either side of the segment. However, given that a point in an instance of the shape class does lie off to one side  of a segment of the shape class template, it is much more likely that the next point also will lie off to that side,  and much less likely that the next point will lie off to the other side. This algorithm does not take advantage of  this conditional probability.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\nThis algorithm could be extended to become rotationally invariant. This could possibly be done by rotating each shape  instance according to an indicative angle from the centroid to the furthest point from the centroid.\r\n\r\nThe conditional ink probability&mdash;addressed in the weaknesses section&mdash;could be taken advantage of with a \"super pixel\" scheme. In this scheme, each pixel in each directional bitmap could contain four additional mxm sub-bitmaps of pixel values. These sub-bitmaps would represent the conditional directional ink probabilities of the neighbors of the given center pixel. Adapting the training of the templates for these bitmaps of super pixels and the distance metric would be a fairly straightforward extension of their current versions. However, this super-pixel scheme would have a much higher time and space complexity.\r\n\r\n### Additional Features\r\n\r\n![Directional bitmaps for the sigma-class template][directional-bitmaps-sigma-template-image]\r\n\r\nThis shows the directional bitmaps for the sigma shape class template.

Current methods of dietary tracking and assessment typically involve paper and  pencil food diaries and/or periodic dietary interviews, and these tend to be imprecise, yielding inconclusive results  as to how a study participant’s diet affects his or her health. Reasons for this imprecision include participant bias, errors in the participant’s memory, errors in the participant’s judgment of food quantities, and underreporting from the participant. The use of computer technology should be able to remedy many of these problems. This project focuses on creating a device based on mobile phones and hand-held computers to record a participant’s dietary intake. This Dietary Data Recording System (DDRS) will serve as a convenient method for real-time documentation of a participant’s intake, and will allow the participant to record both an audio and a visual description of their food. A fundamental aspect of DDRS is the use of a laser-generated grid of distances in coordination with stereo-optic images for the determination of food volume. This device should provide confirmation as to whether real-time computer-assisted recording of dietary data is manageable and accurate.\r\n\r\n[mamishev-url]: http://ee.washington.edu/faculty/mamishev/\r\n[seal-url]: http://ee.washington.edu/research/seal/\r\n[fred-hutch-url]: http://fredhutch.org/en.html\r\n[paper-url]: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5766890&isnumber=5766834&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D5766890%26isnumber%3D5766834"},{"id":"phone-wand","titleShort":"Blind-\naccessible\nnavigation","titleLong":"Phone Wand: A blind-accessible navigation application","emphasis":0.6,"color":"#318895","urls":{"googleCode":"https://code.google.com/p/mobileaccessibility/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FPhoneWand"},"jobTitle":"","location":"","date":{"start":"4/2011","end":"6/2011"},"categories":["School","Research","UW","Android","Java","accessibility","Mobile","google-maps-api","App","Teamwork"],"images":[{"fileName":"fixedinputscreen2.png","description":"This screen presents the current destination.

At any time a route has been specified, the phone can hint which direction to walk when the user  requests assistance using the phone's built-in compass and vibration: (1) the user requests for help by double tapping  the \"magic button\" on an orientation screen, (2) the user moves the phone radially to search for the correct direction  and (3) the phone vibrates when facing the correct direction to continue on the route. This type of assistance is  useful when the user is en route to the next intersection and wishes to verify the current heading along the route, or  if the user has reached an intersection and wishes to receive the heading to the next intersection. The application  also contains features to enable blind-users to more easily input and manage walking routes. This includes a custom  blind-accessible keyboard implementation to more easily input addresses, a \"slide-rule\" based blind-accessible list of  previously entered walking routes, and an ability to save your current location as a new future destination. Such  application is useful for blind users navigating noisy, dense, urban city centers where hearing is difficult, the  application's non-verbal orientation guidance is effective, and where location sensing tools are most accurate.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nNavigating routes can be difficult or time consuming for people who are blind or have low-vision. Navigation  applications that are not blind-accessible make it especially difficult and time consuming for blind users to navigate  the software enter route destination. Another problem is that too much text-to-speech can be obstructive to a blind  persons most important sense, hearing, taking away focus from actual navigation and listening for hazards. While  blind-accessible applications often provide an easy interface to input, they often rely too much on text-to-speech  output.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Phone Wand is to minimize text-to-speech related to actual route navigation but keep only the  text-to-speech necessary for a functioning blind-accessible application. The Phone Wand replaces verbal navigation  feedback with vibrational feedback. This is a relatively new type of interaction that uses orientation as input and  vibration as output. The concept is simple, (1) the user points the phone 360 degrees around her and (2) the phone  vibrates when the user is facing the correct direction. This requires minimal text-to-speech as output, solving our  information flooding problem. However, while the heart of our application uses compass and vibration feedback, our  application still relies on text-to-speech for blind-accessible text entry, traditional list of directions display and  giving application directions.\r\n\r\nThe target group for our application includes blind users and low-vision users who can hear. The compass and vibration  feedback portion of our application is theoretically blind-deaf-accessible. But, we assume that our target group can  hear text-to-speech in order to hear application directions and use the touch keyboard to set up routes in our  application. Theoretically we could make the application completely blind-deaf accessible if we had an option to  translate our input and output methods into some standard method familiar for blind-deaf users.\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\n\r\nHarry is walking to a nearby store on the sidewalk and would like additional help. He pulls out his Android phone and  launches the Phone Wand. After patiently inputting the store's destination, and waiting for the phone to compute the  route, he can press the \"magic button\" to enable the compass driven vibrational orientation feedback mode. After  pointing around for a bit, the phone vibrates in the direction he was heading, indicating that he is en route to the  destination. Minutes later he reaches an intersection and is unsure of this next direction of travel. Pressing the  \"magic button\" again, he points the phone around. This time the phone vibrates when he points it to his left. This  indicates that he should turn left. Harry continues this until he reaches the store, where the phone announces that he  has arrived at his destination.\r\n\r\n## Related Work\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of work previously done for inventing useful methods of route-finding and navigation for blind  users. Most of these previous projects are lacking in some regard such as their accuracy, usability, or availability.  There are many projects involving the creation of a novel navigation device, such as the EYECane project, which  involved the creation of a white cane device with an embedded computer and camera, but we will focus rather on blind-accessible smart phone route-finding/navigation applications.\r\n\r\nMost previous work with smart phone applications involves the use of GPS navigating systems with audio feedback  similar to the systems available for driving. The Sendero Group has created a couple of applications that are similar  to our project. Their LookAround application has a user interface that is very similar to ours, but it only provides information on the user's current location; it does not provide route information. Their Mobile Geo application both finds routes and provides information about locations; however, this costs $788, and uses primarily audio feedback. The Iwalk application is another navigation application similar in to ours, but once again, this application's primary method of user feedback was with audio.\r\n\r\nOur application also relies on special accessible methods of text entry and item selection. Our slide rule list item  selection is based upon an earlier project which allows the user to explore the items by pressing a finger on the item and to select it by double tapping it. Our blind accessible touch keyboard was actually invented from scratch and emulates no prior method of text entry; the key is spoken when a finger presses onto it and is selected when a finger is lifted from it. However, a very similar technique for text entry can be seen in how Apple provides iPhone item exploration and selection with their VoiceOver functionality; with VoiceOver, an item is spoken when pressed or slid over and is selected with a second touch on the screen.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Phone Wand application is to provide a blind-accessible interface and orientation scheme for finding and navigating walking routes. Hence the Phone Wand uses the Google Directions API to calculate walking routes using the Android location service including network assisted GPS. Orientation output from the Android sensor service and vibration features are used for orientation feedback. The Android TextToSpeech (TTS) library is heavily used to communicate application screen directions to users in a blind-accessible manner. The Phone Wand automatically saves, previously entered routes and provides the ability to save the current location. The slide rule selection method is used to display these routes for the users and to display a current list of the walking route directions.\r\n\r\n### Destination Input\r\n\r\nThe Phone Wand features a custom blind-accessible keyboard for entering destinations. This keyboard was created to emulate the familiar iPhone keyboard familiar to many blind users. The user uses the keyboard by holding down on the screen and releasing when the desired letter is called. There is functionality for reading out the entered text, backspace, readout of cursor location, and other features. The done button searches for a route best matching the entered text.\r\n\r\nSince blind-accessible text entry is still relatively time consuming for users, the Phone Wand automatically saves previously entered destinations in a list. A user can access this blind-accessible list and select a destination address. The list is based on a Slide Rule interaction technique (cite slide rule paper). A user can scan the list with her finger while the phone speaks back what is currently underneath her finger. If the list is longer than the screen, the user can scan for the \"next\" and \"previous\" buttons in the list to navigate the list. When the user finds the desired item, she can double tap to confirm the item, which the phone will then search for a route.\r\n\r\n### Navigation Features\r\n\r\nAfter a destination has been entered via keyboard or selected from the list of saved addresses, the phone takes the user to a map screen, which displays a route from the current location to the destination. On this screen, there are several options: (1) recompute a new route from the current location, (2) find a nearby address and save it, (3) access a list of directions, or (4) using the compass and vibration feature.\r\n\r\n(1) Recomputing a route is useful when the user is significantly off course from the original route, or otherwise when the user wants to find a fresh route from the current location. The user can accomplish this by swiping upwards. The phone downloads a new route using the Google Directions API.\r\n\r\n(2) Finding a nearby address and saving it is useful when the user wants to \"bookmark\" the current location for future use. This is accomplished by swiping downwards.\r\n\r\n(3) The user can also access a list of directions. The user can swipe right on the map screen to view the list of directions. The list is blind-accessible: it uses the slide rule interaction. Therefore a user can scan through the list and have the phone speak back the directions. This functionality was implemented to give the user another option.\r\n\r\n(4) Finally, the user can take advantage of the compass and vibration feature on this screen as detailed in the next section.\r\n\r\n### Compass and Vibration\r\n\r\nWhile the map screen provides additional features, the compass and vibration mode is the most prominent feature of our application.\r\n\r\nTo activate the compass and vibration mode, the user double taps on the map screen. (This gesture is referred to as the \"magic button\" because it turns this mode on and off.) Afterwards, the user can move the phone radially around her. The phone vibrates when the user is facing the correct direction. The user should double tap on the map screen again to deactivate the mode and continue walking the direction determined by the phone.\r\n\r\nThe intended use of this compass and vibration mode is to check the user's heading at interest points (like intersections) along the route, or whenever the user simply needs to verify her heading. Therefore, the user should activate the mode, check her heading, and then deactivate immediately. While one can activate the mode and leave it enabled throughout the entire route, it may not be accurate enough to direct the user along the route.\r\n\r\nFor effective feedback from the compass, the user should hold the phone parallel to the ground, move the phone radially (point the phone 360 degrees around the person), and move the phone slowly. Since the compass is not entirely accurate, we advise using this feature to \"check\" the heading occasionally along the route, not to depend on it entirely.\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n\r\nWe foresee a few extensions and modifications of the Phone Wand that would be valuable blind and low-vision accessible  applications.\r\n\r\n### Indoor Navigation using RFID Tags\r\n\r\nWillis and Helal's paper \"RFID information grid for blind navigation and wayfinding\" lays out the foundations needed to use and construct an indoor RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based indoor navigation system. RFID tags are cheap, extremely power efficient devices with immense portability that can hold a small amount of information. They are extremely useful in pervasive computing by (literally) attaching computer data to physical objects. Indoor navigation is solved by rigging buildings with thousands of RFIDs each containing a small piece of geographical information. The advantage of RFID readers vs. GPS is in the locality of the information that can be encoded in the RFID. The construction is based on \"mature technology\" so the limiting factors for widespread use of the infrastructure technology is simply economical feasibility and adoption. With demonstrated success in large corporations and college campuses the technology could be come widespread and worked into building code standards.\r\n\r\nIn order for Android to take advantage and drive this potentially navigation changing technology, Android would either need to implement an internal RFID reader or provide some simple cost-effective RFID reader attachment. The limiting factor is hardware. The implications of a Blind indoor navigation tool would be extremely valuable for users to navigate complicated indoor areas with little or no GPS capabilities such as airports, public transportation terminals, malls, and stadiums.\r\n\r\n### Indoor Navigation using RFID Tags\r\n\r\nA useful extension to the Phone Wand would be transferring orientation and vibration feedback to a walking cane via  Bluetooth. A cane is the most natural and useful tool to aid blind people in everyday walking. This extension would  require embedding hardware for compass sensors and vibration directly into a walking cane. There already exists bulky  and expensive electronic aided canes on the market that use sonar to detect solid obstacles and puddles within a \"zone  of safety\". But user feedback indicates these tend to be too expensive or non-functional for practical use. With the  hardware problem solved, a CaneNavigator Android application would allow users to simply enter all route information  into the cell phone, then the Bluetooth would activate, and then the cell phone could be placed in the users pocket.  All information sensing would then be embedded in the cane and then transferred to the cell phone via Bluetooth.  Information would then be processed and vibration signals would transfer from the phone to the cane via Bluetooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[main-url]: http://code.google.com/p/mobileaccessibility/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FPhoneWand"},{"id":"uw-graphics","titleShort":"OpenGL\nanimations","titleLong":"OpenGL models and animations","emphasis":0.8,"color":"#186303","urls":{},"jobTitle":"","location":"Seattle, WA","date":"2/2011","categories":["School","UW","OpenGL","Animation","3D","C++","Teamwork"],"images":[{"fileName":"screenshot1.png","description":"A screenshot from the program showing a frog playing a ukulele.
