  "content": "#### A dynamic, expandable, animated grid of hexagonal tiles for displaying posts\n\nLevi was bored with the standard grid layout and wanted to play with particle systems and crazy animations. So he made\nhex-grid.\n\n## Features\n\nSome features of this package include:\n\n- A particle system complete with neighbor and anchor position spring forces.\n- An assortment of **persistent** animations that make the grid _exciting to watch_.\n- An assortment of **transient** animations that make the grid _exciting to interact with_.\n- A control panel that enables you to adjust most of the many different parameters of this system.\n- The ability to display custom collections of posts.\n    - These posts will be displayed within individual tiles.\n    - These tile posts can be expanded for more information.\n    - The contents of these posts use standard [Markdown syntax][markdown-url], which is then parsed by the system for\n      displaying within the grid.\n\n## Acknowledgements \/ Technology Stack\n\nThe following packages\/libraries\/projects were used in the development of hex-grid:\n\n- [Gulp.js][gulp-url]\n- [Bower][bower-url]\n- [dat.gui][dat-gui-url]\n- [Showdown][showdown-url]\n- Additional packages that are available via [NPM][npm-url] (these are listed within the `package.json` file)\n\n\n[demo-url]: http:\/\/www.jackieandlevi.com\/hex-grid\n[markdown-url]: http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/projects\/markdown\/\n[dat-gui-url]: http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/dat-gui\n[gulp-url]: http:\/\/gulpjs.com\n[bower-url]: http:\/\/bower.io\n[npm-url]: https:\/\/npmjs.org\n[showdown-url]: https:\/\/github.com\/showdownjs\/showdown"
