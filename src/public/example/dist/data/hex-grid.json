  "content": "#### A dynamic, expandable, animated grid of hexagonal tiles for displaying posts\n\nLevi was bored with the standard grid layout and wanted to play with particle systems and crazy animations. So he made\nhex-grid.\n\n## Features\n\nSome features of this package include:\n\n- A particle system complete with neighbor and anchor position spring forces.\n- An assortment of **persistent** animations that make the grid _exciting to watch_.\n- An assortment of **transient** animations that make the grid _exciting to interact with_.\n- A control panel that enables you to adjust most of the many different parameters of this system.\n- The ability to display custom collections of posts.\n    - These posts will be displayed within individual tiles.\n    - These tile posts can be expanded for more information.\n    - The contents of these posts use standard [Markdown syntax][markdown-url], which is then parsed by the system for\n      displaying within the grid.\n\n## The Tile-Expansion Algorithm\n\nThe following diagrams help to visualize how the grid is expanded.\n\n### A Basic Sector Expansion\n\nThis image illustrates how the grid is expanded in order to show an enlarged area with details for a given tile. The\ngrid is divided into six sectors around the given tile. These are then each translated in a different direction.\n\n![Basic sector expansion][sector-expansion-1-image]\n\n### Sector Expansion with Viewport Panning and Creating New Tiles\n\nThis image illustrates which tile positions lie within the viewport after both the grid has been expanded and panning\nhas occurred in order to center the viewport on the expanded tile. This also illustrates where new tiles will need to\nbe created in order to not show gaps within the expanded grid.\n\n![Basic sector expansion with panning and new tiles][sector-expansion-2-image]\n\n### A Reference for how Neighbor Tile and Sector Data is Stored and Indexed\n\nThis image illustrates how the hex-grid system stores data for three different types of tile relationships. For each\nof these relationships, both the vertical and horizontal grid configurations are illustrated.\n\nEach tile holds a reference to each of its neighbor tiles. These references are stored in an array that is indexed\naccording to the position of the neighbor tiles relative to the given tile. The left-most images show which positions\ncorrespond to which indices.\n\nThe expanded grid holds an array with references to each of the six sectors. The middle images show which sectors\ncorrespond to which indices.\n\nA sector stores references to its tiles within a two-dimensional array. The right-most images show how this\ntwo-dimensional array is indexed.\n\n![Reference for how neighbor tile and sector data is stored and indexed][indices-image]\n\n## Acknowledgements \/ Technology Stack\n\nThe following packages\/libraries\/projects were used in the development of hex-grid:\n\n- [Gulp.js][gulp-url]\n- [Bower][bower-url]\n- [dat.gui][dat-gui-url]\n- [Showdown][showdown-url]\n- Additional packages that are available via [NPM][npm-url] (these are listed within the `package.json` file)\n\n\n[sector-expansion-1-image]: https:\/\/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/levi-portfolio-media\/hex-grid\/hg-sector-expansion-1.png\n[sector-expansion-2-image]: https:\/\/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/levi-portfolio-media\/hex-grid\/hg-sector-expansion-2.png\n[indices-image]: https:\/\/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/levi-portfolio-media\/hex-grid\/hg-indices.png\n\n[markdown-url]: http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/projects\/markdown\/\n[dat-gui-url]: http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/dat-gui\n[gulp-url]: http:\/\/gulpjs.com\n[bower-url]: http:\/\/bower.io\n[npm-url]: https:\/\/npmjs.org\n[showdown-url]: https:\/\/github.com\/showdownjs\/showdown\n"
